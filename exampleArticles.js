      "A massive study of how the United States went to war in Indochina, con ducted by the Pentagon three years ago, demonstrates that four administrations progrestively developed a sense of com mitment to a non‐Communist Vietnam, a readiness to fight the North to pro tect the South, and an ultimate frustra tion with this effort—to a much greater extent than their public statements ac knowledged at the time.\n\nThe 3,000‐page analysis, to which 4,000 pages of official documents are appended, was commissioned by Secre tary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and covers the American involvement in Southeast Asia from World War II to mkr‐1968—the start of the peace talks in Paris after President Lyndon B. John son had set a limit on further military commitments and revealed his intention to retire. Most of the study and many of the appended documents have been obtained by The New York Times and will be described and presented in a series of articles beginning today.\n\nThree pages of documentary material from the Pentagon study begin on Page 35.\n\nThough far from a complete history, even at 2.5 million words, the study forms a great archive of government decision‐making on Indochina over three decades. The study led its 30 to 40 au thors and researchers to many broad conclusions and specific findings, in cluding the following:\n\n¶That the Truman Administration's de cision to give military aid to France in her colonial war against the Communist led Vietminh “directly involved” the United States in Vietnam and “set” the course of American policy.\n\n¶That the Eisenhower Administra tion's decision to rescue a fledgling South Vietnam from a Communist take over and attempt to undermine the new Communist regime of North Vietnam gave the Administration a “direct role in the ultimate breakdown of the Geneva settlement” for Indochina in 1954.\n\n¶That the Kennedy Administration, though ultimately spared from major escalation decisions by the death of its leader, transformed a policy of “lim ited‐risk gamble,” which it inherited, into a “broad commitment” that left President Johnson with a choice between more war and withdrawal.\n\n¶That the Johnson Administration, though the President was reluctant and hesitant to take the final decisions, in tensified the covert warfare against North Vietnam and began planning in the spring of 1964 to wage overt war, a full year before it publicly revealed the depth of its involvement and its fear of defeat.\n\n¶That this campaign of growing clan destine military press the, through 1964 and the expanding program of bombing North Vietnam in 1965 were begun de spite the judgment of the Government's intelligence community that the meas ures would not cause Hanoi to cease its support of the Vietcong, insurgency in the South, and that the bombing was deemed militarily ineffective within a few months.\n\n¶That these four succeeding adminis trations built up the American political, military and psychological stakes in In dochina, often more deeply than they realized at the time, with large‐scale military equipment to the French in 1950; with acts of sabotage and terror warfare against North Vietnam begin ning in 1954; with moves that en couraged and abetted the overthrow of President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Viet nam in 1963; with plans, pledges and threats of further action that sprang to life in the Tonkin Gulf clashes in Au gust, 1964; with the careful preparation of public opinion for the years of open warfare that were to follow; and with the calculation in 1965, as the planes and troops were openly committed to sustained combat, that neither accom modation inside South Vietnam nor early negotiations with North Vietnam would achieve the desired result.\n\nThe Pentagon study also ranges be yond such historical judgments, It sug gests that the predominant American interest was at first containment of Com munism and later the defense of the power, influence and prestige of the United States, in both stages irrespec tive of conditions in Vietnam.\n\nAnd it reveals a great deal about the ways in which several administra tions conducted their business on a fate ful course, with much new information about the roles of dozens of senior of ficials of both major political parties and a whole generation of military com manders.\n\nThe Pentagon study was divided into chronological and thematic chapters of narrative and analysis, each with its own documentation attached. The Times —which has obtained all but one of nearly 40 volumes—has collated these materials into major segments of varying chronological length, from one that broadly covers the two decades be fore 1960 to one that deals intensively with the agonizing debate in the weeks following the 1968 Tet offensive.\n\nThe months from the beginning of 1964 to the Tonkin Gulf incident in August were a pivotal period, the study makes clear, and The Times begins its series with this phase.",

      "WASHINGTON, June 30—Following is the text of the decision by the United States Supreme Court upholding The New York Times and The Washington Post against an effort by the Federal Government to halt publication of articles and documents based on the Pentagon study of the Vietnam war and the texts of the concurring and dissenting opinions:</em>\n\n<strong>Decision</strong>\n\nNew York Times Company, Petitioner, v. United States United States, Petitioner, v. The Washington Post Company et al.\n\nPer curiam.\n\nWe granted certiorari in these cases in which the United States seeks to enjoin The New York Times and The Washington Post from publishing the contents of a classified study entitled “History of U.S. Decision‐Making Proc ess on Viet Nam Policy” (1971).\n\n“Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against its con stitutional validity.” Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70 (1963); see also Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931). The Government “thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the enforcement of such a restraint.” Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe (1971). The District Court for the Southern District of New York in. The New York Times case and the District Court for the District of Colum bia and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in The Washington Post case held that the Gov ernment had not met that burden.\n\nWe agree.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is therefore affirmed. The order of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to enter a judgment af firming the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The stays entered June 21 1971, by the court are vacated. The mandates shall issue forthwith.\n\nSo ordered.\n\n<strong>Concurring Opinions</strong>\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice Douglas, with whom Mr. Justice Black joins, con curring.</strong>\n\nWhile I join the opinion of the Court. I believe it necessary to express my views more fully.\n\nIt should be noted at the onset that the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law ... abridg ing the freedom of speech or of the press.” That leaves, in my view, no room for governmental restraint on the press.\n\nThere is, moreover, no statute bar ring the publication by the press of the material which The Times and Post seek to use. 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e) provides that “whoever having unau thorized possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, ... or information relating to the national defense which information the posses sor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, wilfully communicates ... the same to any person not entitled to receive it ... shall be fined not more than $10, 000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years or both.”\n\nThe Government suggests that the word, “communicates” is broad enough to encompass publication.\n\nThere are eight sections in the chap ter on espionage and censorship, Sec tions 792‐799. In three of those eight, “publish” is specifically mentioned: Sec tion 794 (b) provides, “Whoever in time of war, with the intent that the same shall be communicated to the enemy, collects records, publishes, or commu nicates ... [the disposition of armed forces].”\n\nSection 797 prohibits “reproduces, publishes, sells, or gives away” photos of defense installations.\n\nSection 798 relating to cryptography prohibits: “communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes avail able ... or publishes.” Thus it is appar ent that Congress was capable of and did distinguish between publishing and communication in the various sections of the Espionage Act.\n\nThe other evidence that Section 793 does not apply to the press is a rejected version of Section 793. That version read: “During any national emergency resulting from a war to which the U.S. is a party or from threat of such a war, the President may, by proclamation, prohibit the publishing or communicat ing of, or the attempting to publish, or communicate, any information relating to the national defense, which in his judgment is of such character that it is or might be useful to the enemy.” During the debates in the Senate the First Amendment was specifically cited and that provision was defeated. 55 Cong. Rec. 2166.\n\nJudge Gurfein's holding in The Times case that this act does not apply to this case was therefore pre‐eminently sound. Moreover, the act of Sept. 23, 1950, in amending 18 U.S.C. Section 793, states in Section 1 (b) that:\n\n“Nothing in this act shall be con strued to authorize, require, or establish military or civilian censorship or in any way to limit or infringe upon freedom of the press or of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and no regulation shall be promulgated hereunder having that effect.” 64 Stat. 987.\n\nThus Congress has been faithful to the command of the First Amendment in this area.\n\nSo any power, that the Government possesses must come from its “inherent power.”\n\nThe power to wage war is “the power to wage war successfully.” See Hiraba yashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 93. But the war power stems from a decla ration of war. The Constitution by Arti cle I, Section 8, gives Congress, not the President, power “to declare war.” No where are Presidential wars authorized. We need not decide therefore what lev eling effect the war power of Congress might have.\n\nThese disclosures may have a serious impact. But that is no basis for sanc tioning a previous restraint on the press. As stated by Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 719‐ 720:\n\n“...While reckless assaults upon pub lic men, and efforts to bring obloquy upon those who are endeavoring faith fully to discharge official duties, exert a baleful influence and deserve the se verest condemnation in public opinion, it cannot be said that this abuse is greater, and it is believed to be less, than that which characterized the peri od in which our institutions took shape. Meanwhile, the administration of gov ernment has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and cor ruption have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its protection by unfaith ful officials and of the impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and offi cial neglect, emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press, especially in great cities. The fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint in dealing with official mis conduct.”\n\nAs we stated only the other day in Organization for a Better. Austin v. Keefe, “any pnior restraint on expres sion comes to this court with a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.”\n\nThe Government says that it has in herent powers to go into court and obtain an injunction to protect that national interest, which in this case is alleged to be national security.\n\nNear v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, repudiated that expansive doctrine in no uncertain terms.\n\nThe dominant purpose of the First Amendment was to prohibit the wide spread practice of governmental sup pression of embarrassing information. It is common knowledge that the First Amendment was adopted against the widespread use of the common law of seditious libel to punish the dissemina tion of material that is embarrassing to the powers‐that‐be. See Emerson, “The System of Free Expressions,” C. XIII (1941). The present cases will, I think, go down in history as the most dra matic illustration of that principle. A debate of large proportions goes on in the nation over our posture in Vietnam. That debate antedated the disclosure of the contents of the present documents. The latter are highly relevant to the debate in progress.\n\nSecrecy in government is fundamen tally antidemocratic, perpetuating bu reaticratic errors. Open debate and discussion of public issues are vital to our national health. On public questions there should be “open and robust debate.” New York Times, Inc. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 269‐270.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in The Post case, vacate the stay of the Court of Appeals in The Times case and direct that it affirm the District Court.\n\nThe stays in these cases that have been in effect for more that a week constitute a flouting of the principles of the First Amendment as interpreted in Near v. Minnesota.\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice Brennan, concurring.</strong>\n\nI\n\nI write separately in these cases only to emphasize what should be apparent: that our judgment in the present cases may not be taken to indicate the propri ety, in the future, of issuing temporary stays and restraining orders to block the publication of material sought to be suppressed by the Government. So far as I can determine, never before has the United States sought to enjoin a news paper from publishing information in its possession. The relative novelty of the questions presented, the necessary haste with which decisions were reached, the magnitude of the interests asserted, and the fact that all the parties have concentrated their arguments upon the question whether permanent re straints were proper may have justified at least some of the restraints hereto fore imposed in these cases. Certainly it is difficult to fault the several courts below for seeking to assure that the issues here involved were preserved for ultimate review by this Court. But even if it be assumed that some of the interim restraints were proper in the two cases before us, that assumption has no bear ing upon the propriety of similar ju dicial action in the future. To begin with, there has now been ample time for reflection and judgment; whatever val ues there may be in the preservation of novel questions for appellate review may not support any restraints in the future. More important, the First Amendment stands as an absolute bar to the imposition of judicial restraints in circumstances of the kind presented by these cases.\n\nII\n\nThe error which has pervaded these cases from the outset was the granting of any injunctive relief whatsoever, interim or otherwise. The entire thrust of the Government's claim throughout these cases has been that publication of the material sought to be enjoined “could,” or “might” or “may” prejudice the national interest in various ways. But the First Amendment tolerates ab solutely no prior judicial restraints of the press predicated upon surmise or conjecture that untoward consequences may result. Our cases, it is true, have indicated that there is a single, ex tremely narrow class of cases Pa which the First Amendment's ban on prior judicial restraint may be overriden. Our cases have thus far indicated that such cases may arise only when the nation “is at war,” Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919), during which times “no one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting serv ice or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops.” Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931). Even if the present world situation were assumed to be tantamount to a time of war, or if the power of presently available ar maments would justify even in peace time the suppression of information that would set in motion a nuclear holocaust, in neither of these actions has the Gov ernment presented or even alleged that publication of items from or based upon the material at issue would cause the happening of an event of that nature. “The chief purpose of [the First Amend ment's] guarantee [is] to prevent previ ous restraints upon publication.” Near v. Minnesota, supra, at 713. Thus, only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly and immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can sup port even the issuance of an interim restraining order. In no event may mere conclusions be sufficient: for if the executive branch seeks judicial aid in preventing publication, it must in evitably submit the basis upon which that aid is sought to scrutiny by the judiciary. And, therefore, every restraint issued in this case, whatever its form, has violated the First Amendment— and none the less so because that re straint was justified as necessary to afford the Court an opportunity to ex amine the claim more thoroughly. Un less and until the Government has clearly made out its case, the First Amendment commands that no injunc tion may issues.\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice Stewart, with whom Mr. Justice White joins, con curring.</strong>\n\nIn the governmental structure created by our Constitution, the executive is en dowed with enormous power in the two related areas of national defense and international relations. This power, largely unchecked by the legislative and judicial branches, has been pressed to the very hilt since the advent of the nu clear missile age. For better or for worse, the simple fact is that a Presi dent of the United States possesses vastly greater constitutional independ ence in these two vital areas of power than does, say, a prime minister of a country with a parliamentary form of government.\n\nIn the absence of the governmental checks and balances present in other areas of our national life, the only effec tive restraint upon executive policy and power in the areas of national defense and international affairs may lie in an enlightened citizenry— in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of demo cratic government. For this reason, it is perhaps here that a press that is alert, aware, and free most vitally serves the basic purpose of the First Amendment. For without an informed and free press there cannot be an enlightened people.\n\nYet it is elementary that the success ful conduct of international diplomacy and the maintenance of an effective na tional defense require both confiden tiality and secrecy. Other nations can hardly deal with this nation in an at mosphere of mutual trust unless they can be assured that their confidences will be kept. And within our own exec utive departments, the development of considered and intelligent international policies would be impossible if those charged with their formulation could not communicate with each other free ly, frankly and in confidence. In the area of basic national defense the fre quent need for absolute secrecy is, of course, self‐evident.\n\nI think there can be but one answer to this dilemma, if dilemma it be. The responsibility must be where the power is. If the Constitution gives the execu tive a large degree of unshared power in the conduct of foreign affairs and the maintenance of our national defense, then under the Constitution the execu tive must have the largely unshared duty to determine and preserve the de gree of internal security necessary to exercise that power successfully. It is an awesome responsibility, requiring judgment and wisdom of a high order. I should suppose that moral, political and practical considerations would dic tate that a very first principle of that wisdom would be an insistence upon avoiding secrecy for its own sake.\n\n<strong>If Everything, Then Nothing</strong>\n\nFor when everything is classified, then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless, and to be manip ulated by those intent on self‐protec tion or self‐promotion. I should suppose in short, that the hallmark of a truly effective international security system would be the maximum possible dis closure, recognizing that secrecy can best be preserved only when credi bility is truly maintained. But be that as it may, it is clear to me that it is the constitutional duty of the executive —as a matter of sovereign perogative and not as a matter of law as the courts know law—through the promulgation and enforcement of executive regula tions, to protect the confidentiality nec essary to carry out its responsibilities in the fields of international relations national defense.\n\nThis is not to say that Congress and the courts have no role to play. Undoubt edly Congress has the power to enact specific and appropriate criminal laws to protect Government property and preserve Government secrets. Congress has passed such laws, and several of them are of very colorable relevance to the apparent circumstances of these cases, and if a criminal prosecution is instituted, it will be the responsibility of the courts to decide the applicability of the criminal law under which the charge is brought. Moreover, if Congress should pass a specific law authorizing civil proceedings in this field, the courts would likewise have the duty to decide the constitutionality of such a law as well as its applicability to the facts proved.\n\nBut in the cases before us we are asked neither to construe specific regu lations nor to apply specific laws. We are asked, instead, to perform a func tion that the Constitution gave to the executive, not the judiciary. We are asked, quite simply, to prevent the publication by two newspapers of mate rial that the executive branch insists should not, in the national interest, be published. I arm convinced that the exec utive is correct with respect to some of the documents involved. But I can not say that disclosure of any of them will surely result in direct, immediate and irreparable damage to our nation or its people. That being so, there can under the First Amendment be but one judicial resolution of the issues be fore us.\n\nI join the judgments of the court.\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice Marshall, concurring.</strong>\n\nThe Government contends that the only issue in this case is whether in a suit by the United States, “the First Amendment bars a court from prohibit ing a newspaper from publishing mate rial whose disclosure would pose a grave and immediate danger to the se curity of the United States.” Brief of the Government, at 6. With all due respect, I believe the ultimate issue in this case is even more basic than the one posed by the Solicitor General. The issue is whether this Court or the Congress has the power to make law.\n\nIn this case there is no problem con cerning the Presitilmat's power to clas sify information as “secret” or “top secret.” Congress has specifically recog nized Presidential authority, which has been formally exercised in Executive Order 10501, to classify documents and information. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Section 798; 50 U.S.C. Section 783. Nor is there any issue here regarding the President's power as Chief Executive and Comman der in Chief to protect national security by disciplining employes who disclose information and by taking precautions to prevent leaks.\n\nThe problem here is whether in this particular case the executive branch has authority to invoke the equity juris diction of the courts to protect what it believes to be the national interest. See In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 584 (1895). The Government argues that in addition to the inherent power of any govern ment to protect itself, the President's power to conduct foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief give him authority to impose censor ship on the press to protect his ability to deal effectively with foreign nations and to conduct the military affairs of the country. Of course, it is beyond cavil that the President has broad powers by virtue of his primary responsibility for the conduct of our, foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief. Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948); Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 93 (1943); United States v. Curtiss Wright Export Co., 299 U. S. 304 (1936). And in some situations it may be that under whatever inherent powers the Government may have, as well as the implicit authority derived from the President's mandate to conduct foreign affairs and to act as Commander in Chief there is a basis for the invocation of the equity jurisdiction of this Court as an aid to prevent the publication of material damaging to “national secu rity,” however, that term may be defined.\n\nIt would, however, be utterly incon sistent with the concept of separation of power for this Court to use its power of contempt to prevent behavior that Congress has specifically declined to prohibit. There would be a similar dam age to the basic concept of these co equal branches of government if when the executive has adequate authority granted by Congress to protect “national security,” it can choose instead to invoke the contempt power of a court to enjoin the threatened conduct. The Constitution provides that Congress shall make laws, the President execute laws, and courts interpret law. Youngs stown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952). It did not provide for government by injunction, in which the courts and the “executive can “make law” without regard to the action of Congress. It may be more convenient for the executive if it need only con vince a judge to prohibit conduct rather than to ask the Congress to pass a law, and it may be more convenient to enforce a contempt order than seek a criminal conviction in a jury trial. More over, it may be considered politically wise to get a court to share the respon sibility for arresting those who the executive has probably cause to believe are violating the law. But convenience and political considerations of the mo ment do not justify a basic departure from the principles of our system of government.\n\nIn this case we are not faced with a situation where Congress has failed to provide the executive with broad power to protect the nation from disclosure of damaging state secrets. Congress has on several occasions given extensive consideration to the problem of protect ing the military and strategic secrets of the United States. This consideration has resulted in the enactment of stat utes making it a crime to receive, disclose, communicate, withhold and publish certain documents, photographs, instruments, appliances and informa tion The bulk of these statutes are found to Chapter 37 of U.S.C., Title 18, entitled “Espionage and Censorship.” In that chapter, Congress has provided penalties ranging from a $10,000 fine to death for violating the various statutes.\n\nThus it would seem that in order for this Court to issue an injunction it would require a showing that such an injunction would enhance the already existing power of the Government to act. See Bennett v. Laman, 277 N. Y. 368, 14 N. E. 2d 439 (1938). It is a traditional axiom of equity that a court of equity will not do a useless thing just as it is a traditional axiom that equity will not enjoin the commission of a crime. See Z. Chaffe &amp; E. Re, Equity 4935‐954 (5th ed. 1967); H. Joyce, injunctions sections 58‐60A, (1909). Here there has been no attempt to make such a showing. The Solicitor General does not even mention in his brief whether the Government considers there to be probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or whether there is a conspiracy to commit future crimes.\n\nIf the Government had attempted to show that there was no effective remedy under traditional criminal law, it would have had to show that there is no arguably applicable statute. Of course, at this stage this Court could not and cannot determine whether there has been a violation of a particular statute nor decide the constitutionality of any statute. Whether a good‐faith prosecu tion could have been instituted under any statute could, however, be deter mined.\n\n<strong>Relevant Statute Noted</strong>\n\nAt least one of the many statutes In this area seems relevant to this case, Congress has provided in 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e) that whoever “having unauthorized possesion of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book ... or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, trans mits ... the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employe of the United States entitled to receive it ... shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.” 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e). Congress has also made it a crime to conspire to commit any of the offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e).\n\nIt is true that Judge Gurfein found that Congress had not made it a crime to publish the items and material speci fied in Section 793 (e): He found that the words “communicates, delivers, transmits ...” did not refer to publi cation of newspaper stories. And that view has some support in the legisla tive history and conforms with the past practice of using the statute only to prosecute those charged with ordinary espionage. But see 103 Cong. Rec. 10449 (remarks of Senator Humphrey). Judge Gurfein's view of the statute is not, however, the only plausible construction that could be given. See my brother White's concurring opinion.\n\nEven if it is determined that the Government could not in good faith bring criminal prosecutions against The New York Times and The Washington Post, it is clear that Congress has spe cifically rejected passing legislation that would have clearly given the President the power he seeks here and made the current activity of the newspapers un lawful. When Congress specifically de clines to make conduct unlawful it is not for this Court to redecide those issues —to overrule Congress. See Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube v. Sawyer, 345 U.S. 579 (1952).\n\nOn at least two occasions Congress has refused to enact legislation that would have made the conduct engaged in here unlawful and given the Presi dent the power that he seeks in this case. In 1917 during the debate over the original Espionage Act, still the basic provisions of Section 793, Con gress rejected a proposal to give the President in time of war or threat of war authority to directly prohibit by proclamation the publication of infor mation relating to national defense that might be useful to the enemy. The pro posal provided that:\n\n“During any national emergency re sulting from a war to which the United States is a party, or from threat of such a war, the President may, by proc lamation, prohibit the publishing or com municating of, or the attempting to publish or communicate any informa tion relating to the national defense which, in his judgment, is of such character that it is or might be useful to the enemy. Whoever violates any such prohibition shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by im prisonment for not more than 10 years, or both: provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or restrict any discussion, comment or criticism of the acts or policies of the Government or its representatives or the publication of the same.” 55 Cong. Rec. 1763.\n\n<strong>No Request of Congress</strong>\n\nCongress rejected this proposal after war against Germany had been declared even though many believed that the threat of security leaks and espionage were serious. The executive has not gone to Congress and requested that the decision to provide such power be reconsidered. Instead, the executive comes to this Court and asks that it be granted the power Congress refused to give.\n\nIn 1957 the United States Commission on Government Security fund that “air plane journals, scientific periodicals and even the daily newspaper have featured articles containing information and other data which should have been de leted in whole or in part for security reasons.” In response to this problem the commission, which was chaired by Senator Cotton, proposed that “Con gress enact legislation making it a crime for any person willfully to disclose without proper authorization, for any purpose whatever, information classi fied ‘secret’ or ‘top secret,’ knowing, or having reasonable grounds to believe, such information to have been so classi fied.” Report of Commission on Govern ment Security 619‐620 (1957). After sub stantial floor discussion on the pro posal, it was rejected. See 103 Cong. Rec. 10447‐10450. If the proposal that Senator Cotton championed on the floor had been enacted, the publication of the documents here would certainly have been a crime. Congress refused, how ever, to make it a crime. The Govern ment is here asking this Court to re make that decision. This court has no such power.\n\nEither the Government has the power under statutory grant to use traditional criminal law to protect the country or, if there is no basis for arguing that Congress has made the activity a crime, it is plain that Congress has specifically refused to grant the authority the Gov ernment seeks from this Court. In either case this Court does not have authority to grant the requested relief. It is not for this Court to fling itself into every breach perceived by some Government official, nor is it for this Court to take on itself the burden of enacting law, especially law that Congress has re fused to pass.\n\nI believe that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia should be affirmed and the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit should be reversed insofar as it remands the case for further hearings.\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas joins, concurring.</strong>\n\nI adhere to the view that the Govern ment's case against The Washington Post should have been dismissed and that the injunction against The New York Times should have been vacated without oral argument when the cases were first presented to this Court. I be lieve that every moment's continuance of the injunctions against these news papers amounts to a flagrant, indefen sible and continuing violation of the First Amendment. Furthermore, after oral arguments, I agree completely that we must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the. Second Circuit for the reasons stated by my brothers Douglas and Brennan. In my view it is unfortunate that some of my brethren are apparently willing to hold that the publication of news may some times be enjoined. Such a holding would make a shambles of the First Amend ment.\n\nOur Government was launched in 1789 with the adoption of the Consti tution. The Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment, followed in 1791. Now, for the first time in the 182 years since the founding of the Republic, the Federal courts are asked to hold that the First Amendment does not mean what it says, but rather means that the Government can halt the publication of current news of vital importance to the people of this country.\n\nIn seeking injunctions against these newspapers and in its presentation to the Court, the executive branch seems to have forgotten the essential purpose area History of the First Amendment. When the Constitution was adopted, many people strongly opposed it be cause the document contained no bill of rights to safeguard certain basic freedoms. They especially feared that the new powers granted to a central government might be interpreted to per mit the government to curtail freedom of religion, press, assembly and speech. In response to an overwhelming public clamor, James Madison offered a series of amendments to satisfy citizens that these great liberties would remain safe and beyond the power of government to abridge. Madison proposed what later became the First Amendment in three parts, two of which are set out below, and one of which proclaimed: “The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the free dom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.” The amendments were offered to curtail and restrict the general powers granted to the executive, legislative and judicial branches two years before in the orig inal Constitution. The Bill of Rights changed the original Constitution into a new charter under which no, branch of government could abridge the pebple's freedoms of press, speech, religion and assembly.\n\n<strong>‘Perversion of History’</strong>\n\nYet the Solicitor General argues and some members of the Court appear to agree that the general powers of the Government adopted in the original Constitution should be interpreted to limit and restrict the specifie and em phatic guarantees of the Bill of Rights adopted later. I can imagine no greater perversion of history. Madison and the other framers of the First Amendment, able men that they were, wrote in lan guage they earnestly believed could never be misunderstood: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of the press.” Both the history and lan guage of the First Amendment support the view that the press must be left free to publish news, whatever the source, without censorship, injunctions or prior restraints.\n\nIn the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protec tion it must have to fulfill its essential role in our demobracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the gover nors. The Government's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to cen sure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the Govern ment from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell. In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their courageous re porting, The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly. In revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam war, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the founders hoped and trusted they would do.\n\nThe Government's case here, is based on premises entirely different from those that guided the framers of the First Amendment. The Solicitor General has carefully and emphatically stated:\n\n“Now, Mr. Justice [Black], your con struction of ... [the First Amendment] is well known, and I certainly respect it. You say that no law means no law, and that should be obvious. I can only say, Mr. Justice, that to me it is equally obvious that ‘no law,’ and I would seek to persuade the Court that that is true ... [t]here are other parts of the Con stitution that grant power and respon sibilities to the executive and ... the First Amendment was not intended to make it impossible for the executive to function or to protect the security of the United States.”\n\n<strong>Government Stand Rebutted</strong>\n\nAnd the Government argues in its brief that in spite of the First Amend ment, “the authority of the executive department to protect the nation against publication of information whose dis closure would endanger the national se curity stems from two interrelated sources: the constitutional power of the President over the conduct of foreign affairs and his authority as Command er in Chief.”\n\nIn other words, we are asked to hold that despite the First Amendment's em phatic command, the executive branch, the Congress and the judiciary can make laws enjoining publication of current news and abridging freedom of the press in the name of “national security.” The Government does not even attempt to rely on act of Congress. Instead it makes the bold and dangerously far reaching contention that the courts should take it upon themselves to “make” a law abridging freedom of the press in the name of equity, Presidential power and national security, even when the representatives of the people in Congress have adhered to the com mand of the First Amendment and re fused to make such a law. See concur ring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas, Post.\n\nTo find that the President has “in herent power” to halt the publication of news by resort to the courts would wipe out the First Amendment and de stroy the fundamental liberty and se curity of the very people the Govern ment hopes to make “secure.” No one can read the history of the adoption of the First Amendment without being convinced beyond any doubt that it was injunctions like those sought here that Madison and his collaborators intended to outlaw in this nation for all time.\n\nThe word “security” is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment. The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at, the expense of informed rep resentative government provides no real security for our Republic.\n\nThe framers of the First Amendment, fully aware of both the need to defend a new nation and the abuses of the English and colonial Governments, sought to give this new society strength and security by providing that freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly should not be abridged. This thought was eloquently expressed in 1937 by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes—great man and great Chief Justice that he was— when the Court held a man could not be punished for attending a meeting run by Communists.\n\n“The greater the importance of safe guarding the community from incite ments to the overthrow: of our institu tions by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve in violate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of consti ional government.”\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice White, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart joins, concurring.</strong>\n\nI concur in today's judgments, but only because of the concededly extraor dinary protection against prior, re straints enjoyed by the press under our constitutional system. I do not say that in no circumstances would the First Amendment permit an injunction against publishing information about Government plans or operations. Nor, after examining the materials the Gov ernment characterizes as the most sensitive and destructive, can I deny that revelation of these documents will do substantial damage to public inter ests. Indeed, I am confident that their disclosure will have that result. But I nevertheless agree that the United States has, not satisfied the very heavy burden, which it must meet to warrant an injuction against publication in these cases, at least in the absence of express and appropriately limited Congressional authorization for prior restraints in circumstances such as these.\n\nThe Government's position if simply stated: The responsibility of the execu tive for the conduct of the foreign affairs and for the security of the nation is so basic that the President is entitled to an injunction against pub lication of a newspaper story whenever he can convince a court that the infor mation to be revealed threatens “grave and irreparable” injury to the public interest; and the injunction should issue whether or not the material to be published is classified, whether or not publication would be lawful under relevant criminal statutes enacted by Congress and regardless of the circum stances by which the newspaper came into possession of the information.\n\nAt least in the absence of legislation by Congress, based on its own investi gations and findings, I am quite unable to agree that the inherent powers of the executive and the courts reach so far as to authorize remedies having such sweeping potential for inhibiting publications by the press. Much of the difficulty inheres in the “grave and irreparable danger” standard suggest ed by the United States. If the. United States were to have judgment under such a standard in these cases, our decision would be of little guidance to other courts in other cases, for the material at issue here would not be available from the Court's opinion or from public records, nor would it be published by the press. Indeed, even today where we hold that the United States has not met its burden, the material remains sealed in court rec ords and it is properly not discussed in today's opinions. Moreover, because the, material poses substantial dangers to national interests and because of the hazards of criminal sanctions, a responsible press may choose never to publish the more sensitive materials. To sustain the Government in these cases would start the courts down a long and hazardous road that I am not willing to travel, at least without Con gressional guidance and direction.\n\n<strong>‘Not Easy to Deny Relief’</strong>\n\nIt is not easy to reject the proposition urged by the United. States and to deny relief on its good‐faith claims in these cases that publication will work serious damage to the country. But that dis comfiture is considerably dispelled by the infrequency of prior restraint cases. Normally, publication will occur and the damage be done before the Government has either opportunity or grounds for suppression. So here, publication has already begun and a substantial part of the threatened damage has already occurred. The fact of a massive break down in security is known, access to the documents by many unauthorizes people is undeniable and the efficacy of equitable relief against these or other newspapers to avert anticipated damage is doubtful at best.\n\nWhat is more, terminating the ban on publication of the relatively few sen sitive documents the Government now seeks to suppress does not mean that the law either requires or invites news papers or others to publish them or that they will be immune from criminal ac tion if they do. Prior restraints require an unusually heavy justification under the First Amendment; but failure by the Government to justify prior re straints does not measure its constitu tional entitlement to a conviction for criminal publication. That the Govern ment mistakenly chose to proceed by injunction does not mean that it could not successfully proceed in another way.\n\nWhen the Espionage Act was under consideration in 1917, Congress elimi nated from the bill a provision that would have given the President broad powers in time of war to proscribe, under threat of criminal penalty, the publication of various categories of in formation related to the national de fense. Congress at that time was unwill ing to clothe the President with such far‐reaching powers to monitor the press, and those opposed to this part of the legislation assumed that a neces sary concomitant of such power was the power to “filter out the news to the people through some man.” 55 Cong. Rec. 2008 (1917) (remarks of Senator Ashurst). However, these same mem bers of Congress appeared to have little doubt that newspapers would be subject to criminal prosecution if they insisted on publishing information of the type Congress had itself determined should not be revealed. Senator Ashurst, for example, was quite sure that the editor of such a newspaper (“should be punished if he did publish information as to the movements of the fleet, the troops, the aircraft, the location of powder facto ries, the location of defense works and all that sort of thing.” 55 Cong. Rec. 2009 (1917).\n\nThe Criminal Code contains numerous provisions potentially relevant to these cases. Section 797 makes it a crime to publish certain photographs or drawings of military installations. Section 798, also in precise language, proscribes knowing and willful publications of any classified information concerning the cryptographic systems or communi cation intelligence activities of the United States as well as any informa tion obtained from communication in telligence operations. If any of the mate rial here at issue is of this nature, the newspapers are presumably now on full notice of the position of the United States and must face the consequences if they publish. I would have no diffi culty in sustaining convictions under these sections on facts that would not Justify the intervention of equity and the imposition of a prior restraint.\n\n<strong>Under ‘a Wider Net’</strong>\n\nThe same would be true under those sections of the Criminal Code casting a wider net to protect thee national de fense. Section 798 (e) makes it a crimi nal act for any unauthorized possessor of a document “relating to national de fense” either (1) willfully to communi cate or cause to be communicated that document to any person not entitled to receive it or (2) willfully to retain the document and fail to deliver it to an officer of the United States entitled to receive it. The subsection was added in 1950 because pre‐existing law provided no penalty for the unauthorized pos sessor unless demand for the documents was made. “The dangers surrounding the unauthorized possession of such items; are self‐evident, and it is deemed advisable to require their surrender in such a case, regardless of demand, es pecially since their, unauthorized pos session may be unknown to the authori ties who would otherwise make the de mand.” S. Rep. No. 2369, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1950). Of course, in the cases before us, the unpublished documents have been demanded by the United States and their import has been made known at least to counsel for the news papers involved. In Gorin v. United States, 312 U. S. 19, 28 (1941), the words “national defense” as used in a predecessor of Sec. 793, were held by a unanimous court to have “a well‐under stood connotation”—a “generic concept of broad connotations, referring to the military and naval establishments and the related activities of national pre paredness”—and to be “sufficiently defi nite to apprise the public of prohibited activities” and to be consonant with due process. 312 U. S., at 28. Also, as con strued by the Court in Gorin, informa tion “connected with the national de fense” is obviously not limited to that threatening “grave and irreparable” in jury to the United States.\n\nIt is thus clear that Congress has addressed itself to the problems of pro tecting the security of the country and the national defense from unauthorized disclosure of potentially damaging formation. Cf. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585‐586 (1952): see also id., at 593.628 (Frank furter, J., concurring). Lt has not, how ever, authorized the injunctive remedy against threatened publication. It has apparently been satisfied to rely on criminal sanctions and their deterrent effect on the responsible as well as the irresponsible press. I am not, of course, saying that either of these newspapers has yet committed a crime or that either would commit a crime if they published all the material now in their possession. That matter must await resolution in the context of a criminal proceeding one is instituted by the United States. In that event, the issue of guilt or inno cence would be determined by proce dures and standards quite different from those that have purported to govern these injunctive proceedings.\n\n<strong>Dissents</strong>\n\n<strong>Mr. Chief Justice Burger, dissent ing.</strong>\n\nSo clear are the constitutional limita tions on prior restraint against expres sion, that from the time of Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697 (1931), until recently in Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, (1971), we have had little occasion to be concerned with cases involving prior restraints against news reporting on matters of public interest. There is, therefore, little vari ation among the members of the Court in terms of resistance to prior restraints against publication. Adherence to this basic constitutional principle, however, does not make this case a simple one. In this case, the imperative of a free and unfettered press comes into colli sion with another imperative, the effec tive functioning of a complex modern government, and specifically the effec tive exercise of certain constitutional powers of the executive. Only those who view the First Amendment as an absolute in all circumstances—a View I respect, but reject—can find such a case as this to be simple or easy.\n\nThis case is not simple for another and more immediate reason. We do not know the facts of the case. No District Judge knew all type facts. No Court of Appeals Judge knew all the facts. No member of this Court knows all the facts.\n\nWhy are we in this posture, in which only those judges to whom the First Amendment is absolute and permits of no restraint in any circumstances or for any reason, are really in a position to act?\n\nI suggest we, are in this pasture be cause these cases have been conducted in unseemly haste. Mr. Justice Harlin covers the chronology of events demon strating the hectic pressures under which these cases have been processed and I need not restate them; The prompt setting of these cases reflects our pni vessel abhorrence of prior restraint. But prompt judicial action does not mean unjudicial haste.\n\nHere, moreover, the frenetic haste is due in large part to the manner in which The Times proceeded from the date it obtained the purloined docu ments. It seems reasonably clear now that the haste precluded reasonable and deliberate judicial treatment of these cases and was not warranted. The pre cipitous action of this court aborting a trial not yet completed is not the kind of judicial conduct which ought to attend the disposition of a great issue.\n\n<strong>‘The Public Right to Know’</strong>\n\nThe newspapers make a derivative claim under the First Amendment they, denominate this right as the public right to know; by implication. The Times asserts a sole trusteeship of that right by virtue of its journalist “scoop.” The right is asserted as an absolute. Of course, the First Amendment right itself is not an absolute, as Justice Holmes so long Ago pointed out in his aphorism concerning the right to shout of fire in a crowded theater. There are other ex ceptions, some of which Chief Justice Hughes mentioned by way, of example in Near v. Minnesota. There are no doubt other exceptions no one has had occasion to describe or discuss. Con ceivably such exceptions may be lurking in these cases and would have been flushed had they been properly consid ered in the trial courts, free from un warranted deadlines and frenetic pres sures.\n\nA great issue of this kind should be tried in a judicial atmosphere conducive to thoughtful, reflective deliberation, especially when haste, in terms of hours, is unwarranted in light of the long period The Times, by its own choice, deferred publication.\n\nIt is not disputed that The Times has had unauthorized possession of the documents for three to four months, during which it has had its expert analysts studying them, presumably digesting them and preparing the material for publication. During all of this time, The Times, presumably in its capacity as trustee of the public's “right, to know,” has held up publica tion for purposes it considered proper and thus public knowledge was delayed. No doubt this was for a good reason; the analysis of 7,000 pages of complex material drawn from a vastly greater volume of material would inevitably take time and the writing of good news stories takes time.\n\nBut why should the United States Government, from whom this informa tion was illegally acquired by someone, along with all the counsel, trial judges, and appellate judges be placed under needless pressure? After these months of deferral, the alleged right to know has somehow and suddenly become a right that must be vindicated instanter.\n\nWould it have been unreasonable, since the newspaper could anticipate the Government's objections to release of secret material, to give the Govern ment an opportunity to review the en tire collection and determine whether agreement could be reached on publica tion? Stolen or not, if security was not in fact jeopardized, much of the material could no doubt have been declassified, since it spans a period ending in 1968.\n\n<strong>‘Duty of Honorable Press’</strong>\n\nWith such an approach—one that great newspapers have in the past prac ticed and stated editorially to be the duty of honorable press—the newspa pers and Government might well have narrowed the area of disagreement as to what was and was not publishable, leaving the remainder to be resolved in orderly litigation if necessary. To me it is hardly believable that a newspaper long regarded as a great institution in American life would fail to perform one of the basic and simple duties of every citizen with respect to the discovery or possession of stolen property or secret Government documents. That duty, I had thought—perhaps naively—was to report forthwith, to responsible public officers. This duty rests on taxi drivers, justices and The New York Times. The course followed by The Times, whether so calculated or not, removed any possi bility of orderly litigation of the issues. If the action of the judges up to now has been correct, that result is sheer happenstance.\n\nOur grant of the writ before final judgment in The Times cage aborted the trial in the District Court before it had made a complete record pursuant to the mandate of the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.\n\nThe consequences of all this melan choly series of events is that we liter ally do not know what we are acting on. As I see it we have been forced to deal with litigation concerning rights of great magnitude without an adequate record, and surely without time for adequate treatment either in the prior proceedings or in this court. It is in teresting to note that counsel in oral argument before this Court were fre quently unable to respond to questions on factual points. Not surprisingly they pointed out that they had been work ing literally “around the clock” and simply were unable to review the docu ments that give rise to these cases and were not familiar with them. This Court is in no better posture. I agree with Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Black mun but I am not prepared to reach the merits.\n\nI would affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and allow the District Court to complete the trial aborted by our grant of certiorari, mean while preserving the status quo in The Post case. I would direct that the Dis trict Court on remand give priority to The Times case to the exclusion of all other business of that court but I would not set arbitrary deadlines.\n\nI should add that I am in general agreement with much of what Mr. Jus tice White has expressed with respect to, penal sanctions concerning commu nication or retention of documents or information relating to the national defense.\n\nWe all crave speedier judicial proc esses, but when judges are pressured as in these cases the result is a parody of the judicial process.\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice Harlan, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Jus tice Blackmun join, dissenting.</strong>\n\nThese cases forcefully call to mind the wise admonition of Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting in Northern Secu rities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197, 400.401 (1904):\n\n“Great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases are called great, not by reason of their real im portance in shaping the law of the future, but because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and dis torts the judgment. These immediate interests exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes what previously was clear seem doubtful, and before which even, well settled princinles of law will bend.”\n\nWith all respect, I consider that the Court has been almost irresponsibly feverish in dealing with these cases.\n\nBoth the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Ciruit rendered judgment on June 23. The New York Times's petition for certiorari, its motion for accelerated considera tion thereof, and its application for interim relief were filed in this Court on June 24 at about 11 A.M. The appli cation of the United States for interim relief in The Post case was also filed here on June 24, at about 7:15. P.M. This Court's order setting a hearing before us on. June 26 at 11 A.M., a course which I joined. only to avoid, the possibility of even more peremptory action by the Court, was issued less than 24 hours before. The record in The Post case was filed with the clerk shortly before 1 P.M. on June 25; the record in The Times case did net arrive until 7 or 8 o'clock that same night. The briefs of the parties were received less than two hours before argument on June 26.\n\nThis frenzied train of events took place in the name of the presumption against prior restraints created by the First Amendment. Due regard for the extraordinarily important and difficult questions involved in these litigations should have led the Court to shun such a precipitate timetable. In order decide the merits of these cases prop erly, some or all of the following ques tions should have been faced:\n\n1. Whether the Attorney General is authorized to bring these suits in the name of the United States. Compare In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895), with Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 479 (1952). This ques tion involves as well the construction and validity of a singularly opaque statute—the Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e).\n\n2. Whether the First Amendment per mits the Federal Courts to enjoin publi cation of stories which would present a serious threat to national security, See Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931) (dictum).\n\n3. Whether the threat to publish highly secret documents is of itself a sufficient implication of national secu rity to justify an injunction on the theory that regardless of the contents of the documents harm enough results simply from the demonstration of such a breach of secrecy.\n\n4. Whether the unauthorized dis closure of any of these particular docu ments would seriously impair the national security.\n\n5. What weight should be given to the opinion of high officers in the executive branch of the. Government with respect to questions 3 and 4.\n\n6. Whether the newspapers are en titled to retain and use the documents notwithstanding the seemingly uncon tested facts that the documents, or the original of which they are duplicates, were purloined from the Government's possession and that the newspapers received them with the knowledge that they had been feloniously acquired. Cf. Liberty Lobby, Inc., v. Pearson, 390 F. 2d 489 (CADC 1968).\n\n7. Whether the threatened harm to, the national security or the Govern ment's possessory interest in the docu ments justifies the issuance of an injunction against publication in light of—\n\nA. The strong First Amendment policy against prior restraints on pub lication:\n\nB. The doctrine against enjoining con duct in violation of criminal statutes; and\n\nC. The extent to which the materials at issue have apparently already been otherwise disseminated.\n\n<strong>‘Difficult Questions of Fact, Law’</strong>\n\nThese are difficult questions of fact, of law and of judgment; the potential Consequences of erroneous decision are enormous. The time which has been available to us, to the lower courts and to the parties has been wholly inade quate for giving these cases the kind of consideration they deserve. It is a reflection on the stability of the judicial prdcess that these great issues—as im portant as any that have arisen during my time on the Court—should have been decided under the pressures engendered by the torrent of publicity that has attended these litigations from their inception.\n\nForced as I am to reach the merits of these cases, I dissent from the opinion and judgments of the Court. Within the severe limitations imposed by the time constraints under which I have been required to operate, I can only state my reasons in telescoped form, even though in different circumstances I would have felt constrained to deal with the cases in the fuller sweep indicated above.\n\nIt is a sufficient basis for affirming the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in The Times litigation to ob serve that its order must rest on the conclusion that because of the time elements the Government had not been given an adequate opportunity to pre sent its case to the District Court. At the least this conclusion was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nIn The Post litigation the Government had more time to prepare; this was apparently the basis for the refusal of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on reheating to conform its judgment to that of the Second Circuit But I think there is another and more fundamental reason why this judgment cannot stand—a reason which also furnishes an addi tional ground for not reinstating the judgment of the district court in The Times litigation, set aside by the Court of Appeals. It is plain to me that the scope of the judicial function in passing upon the activities of the executive branch of the Government in the field of foreign affairs is very narrowly re stricted. This view is, I think, dictated by the concept of separation of powers upon which our constitutional system rests.\n\nIn a speech on the floor of the House of. Representatives, Chief Justice John Marshall, then a member of that body, stated:\n\n“The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and a its sole representative with foreign nations.” Annals, 6th Cong., Col. 613 (1800).\n\nFrom that time, shortly after the founding of the nation, to this, there has been no substantial challenge to this description of the scope of executive power. See United States v. Curtiss Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319‐321 (1936), collecting authorities.\n\nFrom this constitutional primacy in the field of foreign affairs, it seems to me that certain conclusions necessarily follow. Some of these were stated con cisely by President Washington, declin ing the request of the House of Repre sentatives for the papers leading up to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty:\n\n“The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy; and even when brought to a conclusion a full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions which may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely impolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations, or produce immediate in conveniences, perhaps danger and mis chief, in relation to other powers.” J. Richardson, “Messages and Papers of the Presidents” 194‐195 (1899).\n\n<strong>Need for Judicial Review Seen</strong>\n\nThe power to evaluate the “pernicious influence” of premature disclosure is not, however, lodged in the executive alone. I agree that, in performance of its duty to protect the values of the First Amendmen against political pres sures, the judiciary must review the initial executive determination to the point of satisfying itself that the subject matter of the dispute does lie within the proper compass of the President's for eign relations power. Constitutional con siderations forbid “a complete abandon ment of judicial control.” Cf. United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 8 (1953). Moreover, the judiciary may properly insist that the determination that disclosure of the subject matter would irreparably impair the national security be made by the head of the executive department concerned —here the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense—after actual personal con sideration by that office. This safe guard is required in the analogous area of executive claims of privilege for se crets of state. See United States v. Reynolds, supra, at 8 and N. 20; Duncan v. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., (1942) A. C. 624, 638 (House of Lords).\n\nBut in my judgment the judiciary may not properly go beyond these two in quiries and redetermine for itself the probable impact of disclosure on the national security.\n\n“The very nature of executive deci cisins as to foreign policy is political, not judicial. Such decisions are wholly confided by our Constitution to the polit ical departments of the Government, executive and legislative. They are deli cate, complex, and involve large ele ment's of prophecy. They are and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil. They are deci sions of a kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor re sponsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.” Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948) (Jackson, J.).\n\nEven if there is some room for the judiciary to override the executive deter mination, it is plain that the scope of review must he exceedingly narrow. I can see no indication in the opinions of either the District Court or the Court of Appeals in The Post litigation that the conclusions of the executive were given even the deference owing to an administrative agency, much less that owing to a coequal constitutional pre rogative.\n\nAccordingly, I would vacate the judg ment of the Court of Appeals for the, District of Columbia Circuit on this ground and remand the case for further proceedings in the District Court. Before the commencement of such further pro ceedings, due opportunity should be afforded the Government for procuring from the Secretary of State or the Sec retary of Defense or both an expression of their views on the issue of national security. The ensuing review by the District Court should be in accordance with the views expressed in this opin ion. And for the reasons stated above I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nPending further hearings in each case conducted under the appropriate ground rules, I would continue the restraints on publication. I cannot believe that the doctrine prohibiting prior restraints reaches to the point of preventing courts from maintaining the status quo long enough to act responsibly in mat ters of such national importance as those involved here.\n\n<strong>Mr. Justice Blackmun.</strong>\n\nI join Mr. Justice Harlan in his dis sent. I also am in substantial accord with much that Mr. Justice White says, by way of admonition, in the latter part of his opinion.\n\nAt this point the focus is on only the comparatively few documents speci fied by the Government as critical. So far as the other material — vast in amount—is concerned, let it be pub lished and published forthwith if the newspapers, once the strain is gone and the sensationalism is eased, still feel the urge so to do.\n\nBut we are concerned here with the few documents specified from the 47 volumes. Almost 70 years ago Mr. Jus tice Holmes, dissenting in a celebrated case, observed:\n\n“Great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases are called great, not by reason of their real im portance in shaping the law of the fu ture, but because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment. These immediate interests ex ercise a kind of hydraulic pressure. ...” Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 400‐401 (1964).\n\nThe present cases, if not great, are at least unusual in their posture and im plications, and the Holmes observation certainly, has pertinent application.\n\nThe New York Times clandestinely devoted a period of three months ex amining the 47 volumes that came into its unauthorized possession. Once it had begun publication of material from those volumes, the New York case now before us emerged. It immediately as sullied, and ever since has maintained, a frenetic pace and character. Seemingly, once publication started, the material could not be made public fast enough. Seemingly, from then on, every deferral or delay, by restraint or otherwise, was abhorrent and was to be deemed viola tive of the First Amendment and of the public's “right immediately to know.” Yet that newspaper stood before us at oral argument and professed:, criticism of the Government for not lodging its protest earlier than by a Monday tele gram following the initial Sunday pub libation.\n\nThe District of Columbia case is much the same.\n\n<strong>‘Pressed Into Hurried Decision’</strong>\n\nTwo Federal District Courts, two United States Courts of Appeals, and this Court—within a period of less than three weeks from inception until today —have been pressed into hurried de cision of profound constitutional issues on inadequately developed and largely assumed facts without the careful de liberation that, hopefully, should charac terize the American judicial process. There has been much writing about the law and little knowledge and less diges tion of the facts. In the New York case the judges, both trial and appellate, had not yet examined the basic material when the case was brought here. In the District of Columbia case, little more was done, and what was accomplished in this respect was only on required re mand, with The Washington Post, on the excuse that it was trying to protect its source of information, initially refusing to reveal what material it actually pos sessed, and with the District Court forced to make assumptions as to that possession.\n\nWith such respect as may be due to the contrary view, this, in my opinion, is not the way to try a law suit of this magnitude and asserted im portance. It is not the way for Federal Courts to adjudicate, and to be re quired to adjudicate, issues that al legedly concern the nation's vital wel fare. The country would be none the worse off were the cases tried quickly, to be sure, but in the customary and properly deliberative manner. The most recent of the material, it is said, date, no later than 1968, already about three years ago, and The Times itself took three months to formulate its plan of procedure and, thus, deprived its public for that period.\n\nThe First Amendment, after all, is only one part of an entire Constitution. Article II of the great document vests in the executive branch primary power over the conduct of foreign affairs and places in that branch the responsibility for the nation's safety.\n\nEach provision of the Constitution is important, and I cannot subscribe to a doctrine of unlimited absolutism for the First Amendment at the cost of downgrading other provisions.\n\nFirst Amendment absolutism has never commanded a majority of this court. See, for example, Near v. Min nesota, 283 U.S. 697, 708 (1931), and Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919). What IT needed here is weighing, upon properly developed standards, of the broad right of the press to print and of the very narrow right of the Government to prevent. Such standards are not yet developed. The parties here are in disagreement as to what those standards should be. But even the newspapers concede that there are situations where restraint in order and is constitutional. Mr. Jus tice Holmes gave us a suggestion when he said in Schenck:\n\n“It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.” 249 U.S., at 52.\n\n<strong>‘Better Quality,’ of Presentation</strong>\n\nI therefore would remand these cases to be developed expeditiously, of course, but on a schedule permitting the order ly presentation of evidence from both sides, with the use of discovery, if necessary, as authorized by the rules, and with the preparation of briefs, oral argument and court opinions of a qual ity better than has been seen to this point. In making this last statement, I criticize no lawyer or judge. I know from past personal experience the agony of time pressure in the preparation of litigation. But these cases and the is sues involved and the courts, including this one, deserve better than has been produced thus far.\n\nIt may well be that if these cases were allowed to develop as they should be developed, and to be tried as lawyers should try them and as courts should hear them, free of pressure and panic and sensationalism, other light would be shed on the situation and contrary considerations, for me, might prevail. But that is not the present posture of the litigation.\n\nThe Court, however, decides the cases today the other way. I therefore add one final comment.\n\nI strongly urge, and sincerely hope, that these two newspapers will be fully aware of their ultimate respon sibilities to the United States of Amer ica. Judge Wilkey, dissenting in the Dis trict of Columbia case, after a review of only the affidavits before this Court, (the basic papers had not then been made available by either party), con cluded that there were a number of examples of documents that, if in the possession of The Post, and if published, “could clearly result in great harm to the nation,” and he defined “harm” to mean “the death of soldiers, and de struction of alliances, the greatly in creased difficulty of negotiation with our enemies, the inability of our diplo mats to negotiate ....” I, for one, have now been able to give at least some cursory study not only to the affidavits, but to the material itself. I regret to say that from this examination I fear that Judge Wilkey's statements have possible foundation. I therefore share his concern. I hope that damage already has not been done. If, however, damage has been done, and if, with the Court's action today, these newspapers proceed to publish the critical documents and there results therefrom “the death of soldiers, the destruction of alliances, the greatly in creased difficulty of negotiation with our enemies, the inability of our diplo mats to negotiate,” to which list I might add the factors of prolongation of the war and of further delay in the freeing of United States prisoners, then the nation's people will know where the responsibility for these sad conse quences rests.",

      "A live, noncommercial radio network will begin operation May 3 with the hook‐up of 90 stations, including New York City's two outlets, WNYC and WNYC‐FM.\n\nNational Public Radio, fi nanced by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, will start With a review of news and per sonalities from 5 to 6:30 P.M., Mondays through Fridays. The next steps will be the establish ment of a morning radio news service and the development of a full day of cultural attrac tions, including dramas, sym phony orchestras and operas, on Saturdays.\n\n<strong>Access to Programing</strong>\n\nRobert Conley, a former member of the staff of The New York Times and later a foreign correspondent for the National Broadcasting Compa ny, will be the anchor man of the news program. The news editor will be Cleve Mathews, former associate news editor in the Washington Bureau of The Times.\n\nDonald R. Quayle, president of National Public Radio, has made arrangements to have access to the news programing of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and is now abroad to arrange for the pickup of news reports from the British Broadcasting Corporation and the French and Swedish radio systems. When events warrant, the N.P.R. news service will pick up the Moscow radio via short wave.\n\nBefore leaving on his trip, Mr. Quayle said his nonprofit organization wanted to prove that the radio medium was far from “bedridden.” He believed that by alert and in‐depth journalism the flexibility and economy of the sound medium could render a service tele vision could not match.\n\nThe headquarters of National Public Radio will be in Wash ington but the noncommercial network will jump around live to its affiliated stations for news events in their areas. The network will cover 32 states from Maine to California.\n\nThere are 457 noncommercial stations in operation in this conutry, but National Public Radio is requiring outlets to meet a standard of continuity of service and adequate per sonnel before joining the net work. The figure of 90 af filiates is expected to increase with time, and National Public Radio will make tapes of shows available to high school or col lege radio systems in the in terim.\n\n<strong>Conducting Dry Runs</strong>\n\nThe Washington news head quarters of N.P.R. is now con ducting dry runs of the service to be opened May 3. The late afternoon hours and eventually the early morning period are designed to catch the attention of motorists on their way to work.\n\nInstead of a succession of bulletins, Mr. Quayle believes there is a public demand for background material to put a day's events into perspective and that 90 minutes is required to do the job with thoroughness and meaning, No commercial network at present runs a news service of such length.\n\nWilliam Siemering is over all program director of National Public Radio. He said the serv ice's goal was to acquaint listeners with the availability of an impartial roundup of any news event of significance rather than tease listeners with superficial bulletins that fre quently leave set‐owners with many unanswered questions.\n\nAs National Public Radio moves into the cultural area, Mr. Siemering said, the object is to celebrate the human ex perience as “infinitely varied rather than vacuous and banal.”\n\nWith the aid of the Corpora tion for Public Broadcasting, the new network expects to make grants to individual sta tions to enable them to con tribute to the schedule.",

      "There is a special tension that surrounds Apollo 14, its astronauts, its ground crew and the vast United States space organization these final hours before this after noon's scheduled launch in the fourth attempt to land men on the moon. This flight represents a fateful and perhaps decisive step in this country's program of manned lunar exploration.\n\nA major success on the magnificent scale of Apollos 11 and 12 could conceivably inject new life into the effort and stimulate an increase in the limited number of additional Apollo expeditions now scheduled. Dis appointment reminiscent of that following the Apollo 13 flight could conceivably mean an end to this, effort and a cancellation of the remaining planned. Apollo launches.\n\nA year and a half ago, the Apollo program caught the imagination and the admiration of the world because of the success of Neil Armstrong and his crevvmates. The television pictures of the first men on the moon joined mankind in common pride over the realization of a mil lennial dream. The first moon rocks brought back by Apollo 11 were treated—and properly so—as priceless treasures of almost infinite value to science.\n\nToday, however, the atmosphere is far different. Pres ent plans call for only three, more Apollo flights after Apollo 14. A technology which cost the nation more than $20 billion to acquire is, in effect, being largely discarded as NASA pins its hope for survival on the Skylab, a manned orbiting space station whose focus will be directed toward earth far more than toward the planets and stars.\n\nIf the atmophere in which Apollo 14 waits to begin its journey is radically changed from that of any of its predecessors, there has been no change in the courage required of astronauts nor in the skill and devotion needed by the launch crew and the operational personnel on earth. Manned flights to the moon are supreme chal lenges to human bravery and ingenuity. We wish all concerned with Apollo 14 the very best of fortune and a safe return to earth.",

      "The historic decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the United States Government vs. The New York Times and The Washington Post is a ringing victory for freedom under law. By lifting the restraining order that had pre vented this and other newspapers from publishing the hitherto secret Pentagon Papers, the nation's highest tribunal strongly reaffirmed the guarantee of the peo ple's right to know, implicit in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThis was the essence of what The New York Times and other newspapers were fighting for and this is the essence of the Court's majority opinions. The basic ques tion, which goes to the very core of the American polit ical system, involved the weighing by the Court of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom against the Government's power to restrict that freedom in the name of national security. The Supreme Court did not hold that the First Amendment gave an absolute right to pub lish anything under all circumstances. Nor did The Times seek that right. What The Times sought, and what the Court upheld, was the right to publish these particular documents at this particular time without prior Govern mental restraint.\n\nThe crux of the problem lay indeed in this question of prior restraint. For the first time in the history of the United States, the Federal Government had sought through the courts to prevent publication of material that it main tained would do “irreparable injury” to the national security if spread before the public. The Times, support ed in this instance by the overwhelming majority of the American press, held on the contrary that it was in the national interest to publish this information, which was of historic rather than current operational nature.\n\nIf the documents had involved troop movements, ship sailings, imminent military plans, the case might have been quite different; and in fact The Times would not have endeavored to publish such material. But this was not the case; the documents and accompanying analysis are historic, in no instance going beyond 1968, and inca pable in 1971 of harming the life of a single human being or interfering with any current military operation. The majority of the Court clearly recognized that embarrass ment of public officials in the past—or even in the pres ent—is insufficient reason to overturn what Justice White described as “the concededly extraordinary protection against prior restraint under our constitutional system.”\n\nSo far as the Government's classification of the mate rial is concerned, it is quite true, as some of our critics have observed, that “no one elected The Times” to declassify it. But it is also true, as the Court implicitly recognizes, that the public interest is not served by classification and retention in secret form of vast amounts of information, 99.5 per cent of which a retired senior civil servant recently testified “could not be prej udicial to the defense interests of the nation.”\n\nOut of this case should surely come a total revision of governmental procedures and practice in the entire area of classification of documents. Everyone who has ever had anything to do with such documents knows that for many years the classification procedures have been hopelessly muddled by inertia, timidity and sometimes even stupidity and venality.\n\nBeyond all this, one may hope that the entire exercise will induce the present Administration to re‐examine its own attitudes toward secrecy, suppression and restric tion of the liberties of free man in a free society. The issue the Supreme Court decided yesterday touched the heart of this republic; and we fully realize that this is not so much a victory for any particular newspaper as it is for the basic principles of freedom on which the American form of government rests. This, is really the profound message of yesterday's decision, in which this newspaper rejoices with humility and with the conscious ness that the freedom thus reaffirmed carries with it, as always, the reciprocal obligation to présent the truth to the American public so far as it can be determined. That is, in fact, why the Pentagon material had to be published. It is only with the fullest possible understanding of the facts and of the background of any policy decision that the American people can be expected to play the role required of them in this democracy.\n\nIt would be well for the present Administration, in the light of yesterday's decision, to reconsider with far more care and understanding than it has in the past, the fundamental importance of individual freedoms—includ ing especially freedom of speech, of the press, of assem bly—to the life of the American democracy. “Without an informed and free press,” as Justice Stewart said, “there cannot be an enlightened people.”",
