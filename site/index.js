Section 793 (e) provides that “whoever having <strong style="color: #e67e22">unau thorized </strong>possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, ... or information relating to the national defense which information the posses sor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, wilfully communicates ... the same to any person not entitled to receive it ... shall be fined not more than $10, 000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years or both.”',"The Government suggests that the word, “communicates” is broad enough to encompass publication.",'There are eight sections in the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">chap ter </strong>on espionage and censorship, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Sec tions </strong>792‐799. In three of those eight, “publish” is specifically mentioned: <strong style="color: #f39c12">Sec tion </strong>794 (b) provides, “Whoever in time of war, with the intent that the same shall be communicated to the enemy, collects records, publishes, or <strong style="color: #27ae60">commu nicates </strong>...

That version read: “During any national emergency resulting from a war to which the U.S. is a party or from threat of such a war, the President may, by proclamation, prohibit the publishing or <strong style="color: #e74c3c">communicat ing </strong>of, or the attempting to publish, or communicate, any information relating to the national defense, which in his judgment is of such character that it is or might be useful to the enemy.” During the debates in the Senate the First Amendment was specifically cited and that provision was defeated. 55 Cong. Rec. 2166.',"Judge Gurfein's holding in The Times case that this act does not apply to this case was therefore pre‐eminently sound. Moreover, the act of Sept. 23, 1950, in amending 18 U.S.C. Section 793, states in Section 1 (b) that:",'“Nothing in this act shall be <strong style="color: #8e44ad">con strued </strong>to authorize, require, or establish military or civilian censorship or in any way to limit or infringe upon freedom of the press or of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and no regulation shall be promulgated hereunder having that effect.” 64 Stat. 987.',"Thus Congress has been faithful to the command of the First Amendment in this area.","So any power, that the Government possesses must come from its “inherent power.”",'The power to wage war is “the power to wage war successfully.” See <strong style="color: #f39c12">Hiraba yashi </strong>v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 93. But the war power stems from a <strong style="color: #27ae60">decla ration </strong>of war. The Constitution by <strong style="color: #3498db">Arti cle </strong>I, Section 8, gives Congress, not the President, power “to declare war.” No where are Presidential wars authorized. We need not decide therefore what <strong style="color: #e67e22">lev eling </strong>effect the war power of Congress might have.','These disclosures may have a serious impact. But that is no basis for <strong style="color: #e74c3c">sanc tioning </strong>a previous restraint on the press. As stated by Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 719‐ 720:','“...While reckless assaults upon <strong style="color: #8e44ad">pub lic </strong>men, and efforts to bring obloquy upon those who are endeavoring faith fully to discharge official duties, exert a baleful influence and deserve <strong style="color: #f39c12">the se </strong>verest condemnation in public opinion, it cannot be said that this abuse is greater, and it is believed to be less, than that which characterized the <strong style="color: #27ae60">peri od </strong>in which our institutions took shape. Meanwhile, the administration of <strong style="color: #3498db">gov ernment </strong>has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and <strong style="color: #e67e22">cor ruption </strong>have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its protection by <strong style="color: #e74c3c">unfaith ful </strong>officials and of the impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and <strong style="color: #8e44ad">offi cial </strong>neglect, emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press, especially in great cities. The fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint in dealing with official mis conduct.”','As we stated only the other day in Organization for a Better. Austin v. Keefe, “any pnior restraint on <strong style="color: #f39c12">expres sion </strong>comes to this court with a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.”','The Government says that it has <strong style="color: #27ae60">in herent </strong>powers to go into court and obtain an injunction to protect that national interest, which in this case is alleged to be national security.',"Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, repudiated that expansive doctrine in no uncertain terms.",'The dominant purpose of the First Amendment was to prohibit the wide spread practice of governmental <strong style="color: #3498db">sup pression </strong>of embarrassing information. It is common knowledge that the First Amendment was adopted against the widespread use of the common law of seditious libel to punish the <strong style="color: #e67e22">dissemina tion </strong>of material that is embarrassing to the powers‐that‐be. See Emerson, “The System of Free Expressions,” C. XIII (1941). The present cases will, I think, go down in history as the most <strong style="color: #e74c3c">dra matic </strong>illustration of that principle. A debate of large proportions goes on in the nation over our posture in Vietnam. That debate antedated the disclosure of the contents of the present documents. The latter are highly relevant to the debate in progress.','Secrecy in government is <strong style="color: #8e44ad">fundamen tally </strong>antidemocratic, perpetuating bu reaticratic errors. Open debate and discussion of public issues are vital to our national health. On public questions there should be “open and robust debate.” New York Times, Inc. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 269‐270.',"I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in The Post case, vacate the stay of the Court of Appeals in The Times case and direct that it affirm the District Court.","The stays in these cases that have been in effect for more that a week constitute a flouting of the principles of the First Amendment as interpreted in Near v. Minnesota.","Mr. Justice Brennan, concurring.","I",'I write separately in these cases only to emphasize what should be apparent: that our judgment in the present cases may not be taken to indicate the <strong style="color: #f39c12">propri ety, </strong>in the future, of issuing temporary stays and restraining orders to block the publication of material sought to be suppressed by the Government. So far as I can determine, never before has the United States sought to enjoin a news paper from publishing information in its possession. The relative novelty of the questions presented, the necessary haste with which decisions were reached, the magnitude of the interests asserted, and the fact that all the parties have concentrated their arguments upon the question whether permanent <strong style="color: #27ae60">re straints </strong>were proper may have justified at least some of the restraints hereto fore imposed in these cases. Certainly it is difficult to fault the several courts below for seeking to assure that the issues here involved were preserved for ultimate review by this Court. But even if it be assumed that some of the interim restraints were proper in the two cases before us, that assumption has no <strong style="color: #3498db">bear ing </strong>upon the propriety of similar <strong style="color: #e67e22">ju dicial </strong>action in the future. To begin with, there has now been ample time for reflection and judgment; whatever <strong style="color: #e74c3c">val ues </strong>there may be in the preservation of novel questions for appellate review may not support any restraints in the future. More important, the First Amendment stands as an absolute bar to the imposition of judicial restraints in circumstances of the kind presented by these cases.',"II",'The error which has pervaded these cases from the outset was the granting of any injunctive relief whatsoever, interim or otherwise. The entire thrust of the Government\'s claim throughout these cases has been that publication of the material sought to be enjoined “could,” or “might” or “may” prejudice the national interest in various ways. But the First Amendment tolerates <strong style="color: #8e44ad">ab solutely </strong>no prior judicial restraints of the press predicated upon surmise or conjecture that untoward consequences may result. Our cases, it is true, have indicated that there is a single, <strong style="color: #f39c12">ex tremely </strong>narrow class of cases Pa which the First Amendment\'s ban on prior judicial restraint may be overriden. Our cases have thus far indicated that such cases may arise only when the nation “is at war,” Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919), during which times “no one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting <strong style="color: #27ae60">serv ice </strong>or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops.” Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931). Even if the present world situation were assumed to be tantamount to a time of war, or if the power of presently available <strong style="color: #3498db">ar maments </strong>would justify even in peace time the suppression of information that would set in motion a nuclear holocaust, in neither of these actions has the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Gov ernment </strong>presented or even alleged that publication of items from or based upon the material at issue would cause the happening of an event of that nature. “The chief purpose of [the First <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Amend ment\'s] </strong>guarantee [is] to prevent <strong style="color: #8e44ad">previ ous </strong>restraints upon publication.” Near v. Minnesota, supra, at 713. Thus, only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly and immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can <strong style="color: #f39c12">sup port </strong>even the issuance of an interim restraining order. In no event may mere conclusions be sufficient: for if the executive branch seeks judicial aid in preventing publication, it must <strong style="color: #27ae60">in evitably </strong>submit the basis upon which that aid is sought to scrutiny by the judiciary. And, therefore, every restraint issued in this case, whatever its form, has violated the First Amendment— and none the less so because that <strong style="color: #3498db">re straint </strong>was justified as necessary to afford the Court an opportunity to <strong style="color: #e67e22">ex amine </strong>the claim more thoroughly. <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Un less </strong>and until the Government has clearly made out its case, the First Amendment commands that no <strong style="color: #8e44ad">injunc tion </strong>may issues.','Mr. Justice Stewart, with whom Mr. Justice White joins, <strong style="color: #f39c12">con curring.</strong>','In the governmental structure created by our Constitution, the executive is <strong style="color: #27ae60">en dowed </strong>with enormous power in the two related areas of national defense and international relations. This power, largely unchecked by the legislative and judicial branches, has been pressed to the very hilt since the advent of the <strong style="color: #3498db">nu clear </strong>missile age. For better or for worse, the simple fact is that a <strong style="color: #e67e22">Presi dent </strong>of the United States possesses vastly greater constitutional <strong style="color: #e74c3c">independ ence </strong>in these two vital areas of power than does, say, a prime minister of a country with a parliamentary form of government.','In the absence of the governmental checks and balances present in other areas of our national life, the only <strong style="color: #8e44ad">effec tive </strong>restraint upon executive policy and power in the areas of national defense and international affairs may lie in an enlightened citizenry— in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of <strong style="color: #f39c12">demo cratic </strong>government. For this reason, it is perhaps here that a press that is alert, aware, and free most vitally serves the basic purpose of the First Amendment. For without an informed and free press there cannot be an enlightened people.','Yet it is elementary that the <strong style="color: #27ae60">success ful </strong>conduct of international diplomacy and the maintenance of an effective <strong style="color: #3498db">na tional </strong>defense require both <strong style="color: #e67e22">confiden tiality </strong>and secrecy. Other nations can hardly deal with this nation in an <strong style="color: #e74c3c">at mosphere </strong>of mutual trust unless they can be assured that their confidences will be kept. And within our own <strong style="color: #8e44ad">exec utive </strong>departments, the development of considered and intelligent international policies would be impossible if those charged with their formulation could not communicate with each other <strong style="color: #f39c12">free ly, </strong>frankly and in confidence. In the area of basic national defense the <strong style="color: #27ae60">fre quent </strong>need for absolute secrecy is, of course, self‐evident.','I think there can be but one answer to this dilemma, if dilemma it be. The responsibility must be where the power is. If the Constitution gives the <strong style="color: #3498db">execu tive </strong>a large degree of unshared power in the conduct of foreign affairs and the maintenance of our national defense, then under the Constitution the <strong style="color: #e67e22">execu tive </strong>must have the largely unshared duty to determine and preserve the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">de gree </strong>of internal security necessary to exercise that power successfully. It is an awesome responsibility, requiring judgment and wisdom of a high order. I should suppose that moral, political and practical considerations would <strong style="color: #8e44ad">dic tate </strong>that a very first principle of that wisdom would be an insistence upon avoiding secrecy for its own sake.',"If Everything, Then Nothing",'For when everything is classified, then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless, and to be <strong style="color: #f39c12">manip ulated </strong>by those intent on self‐protec tion or self‐promotion. I should suppose in short, that the hallmark of a truly effective international security system would be the maximum possible <strong style="color: #27ae60">dis closure, </strong>recognizing that secrecy can best be preserved only when <strong style="color: #3498db">credi bility </strong>is truly maintained. But be that as it may, it is clear to me that it is the constitutional duty of the executive —as a matter of sovereign perogative and not as a matter of law as the courts know law—through the promulgation and enforcement of executive <strong style="color: #e67e22">regula tions, </strong>to protect the confidentiality <strong style="color: #e74c3c">nec essary </strong>to carry out its responsibilities in the fields of international relations national defense.','This is not to say that Congress and the courts have no role to play. <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Undoubt edly </strong>Congress has the power to enact specific and appropriate criminal laws to protect Government property and preserve Government secrets. Congress has passed such laws, and several of them are of very colorable relevance to the apparent circumstances of these cases, and if a criminal prosecution is instituted, it will be the responsibility of the courts to decide the applicability of the criminal law under which the charge is brought. Moreover, if Congress should pass a specific law authorizing civil proceedings in this field, the courts would likewise have the duty to decide the constitutionality of such a law as well as its applicability to the facts proved.','But in the cases before us we are asked neither to construe specific <strong style="color: #f39c12">regu lations </strong>nor to apply specific laws. We are asked, instead, to perform a <strong style="color: #27ae60">func tion </strong>that the Constitution gave to the executive, not the judiciary. We are asked, quite simply, to prevent the publication by two newspapers of <strong style="color: #3498db">mate rial </strong>that the executive branch insists should not, in the national interest, be published. I arm convinced that the <strong style="color: #e67e22">exec utive </strong>is correct with respect to some of the documents involved. But I can not say that disclosure of any of them will surely result in direct, immediate and irreparable damage to our nation or its people. That being so, there can under the First Amendment be but one judicial resolution of the issues <strong style="color: #e74c3c">be fore </strong>us.',"I join the judgments of the court.","Mr. Justice Marshall, concurring.",'The Government contends that the only issue in this case is whether in a suit by the United States, “the First Amendment bars a court from <strong style="color: #8e44ad">prohibit ing </strong>a newspaper from publishing <strong style="color: #f39c12">mate rial </strong>whose disclosure would pose a grave and immediate danger to <strong style="color: #27ae60">the se </strong>curity of the United States.” Brief of the Government, at 6. With all due respect, I believe the ultimate issue in this case is even more basic than the one posed by the Solicitor General. The issue is whether this Court or the Congress has the power to make law.','In this case there is no problem <strong style="color: #3498db">con cerning </strong>the Presitilmat\'s power to <strong style="color: #e67e22">clas sify </strong>information as “secret” or “top secret.” Congress has specifically <strong style="color: #e74c3c">recog nized </strong>Presidential authority, which has been formally exercised in Executive Order 10501, to classify documents and information. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Section 798; 50 U.S.C. Section 783. Nor is there any issue here regarding the President\'s power as Chief Executive and <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Comman der </strong>in Chief to protect national security by disciplining employes who disclose information and by taking precautions to prevent leaks.','The problem here is whether in this particular case the executive branch has authority to invoke the equity <strong style="color: #f39c12">juris diction </strong>of the courts to protect what it believes to be the national interest. See In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 584 (1895). The Government argues that in addition to the inherent power of any <strong style="color: #27ae60">govern ment </strong>to protect itself, the President\'s power to conduct foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief give him authority to impose censor ship on the press to protect his ability to deal effectively with foreign nations and to conduct the military affairs of the country. Of course, it is beyond cavil that the President has broad powers by virtue of his primary responsibility for the conduct of our, foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948); Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 93 (1943); United States v. Curtiss Wright Export Co., 299 U. S. 304 (1936). And in some situations it may be that under whatever inherent powers the Government may have, as well as the implicit authority derived from the President\'s mandate to conduct foreign affairs and to act as Commander in Chief there is a basis for the invocation of the equity jurisdiction of this Court as an aid to prevent the publication of material damaging to “national <strong style="color: #3498db">secu rity,” </strong>however, that term may be defined.','It would, however, be utterly <strong style="color: #e67e22">incon sistent </strong>with the concept of separation of power for this Court to use its power of contempt to prevent behavior that Congress has specifically declined to prohibit. There would be a similar <strong style="color: #e74c3c">dam age </strong>to the basic concept of these <strong style="color: #8e44ad">co equal </strong>branches of government if when the executive has adequate authority granted by Congress to protect “national security,” it can choose instead to invoke the contempt power of a court to enjoin the threatened conduct. The Constitution provides that Congress shall make laws, the President execute laws, and courts interpret law. Youngs stown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952). It did not provide for government by injunction, in which the courts and the “executive can “make law” without regard to the action of Congress. It may be more convenient for the executive if it need only con vince a judge to prohibit conduct rather than to ask the Congress to pass a law, and it may be more convenient to enforce a contempt order than seek a criminal conviction in a jury trial. More over, it may be considered politically wise to get a court to share the <strong style="color: #f39c12">respon sibility </strong>for arresting those who the executive has probably cause to believe are violating the law. But convenience and political considerations of the <strong style="color: #27ae60">mo ment </strong>do not justify a basic departure from the principles of our system of government.','In this case we are not faced with a situation where Congress has failed to provide the executive with broad power to protect the nation from disclosure of damaging state secrets. Congress has on several occasions given extensive consideration to the problem of <strong style="color: #3498db">protect ing </strong>the military and strategic secrets of the United States. This consideration has resulted in the enactment of <strong style="color: #e67e22">stat utes </strong>making it a crime to receive, disclose, communicate, withhold and publish certain documents, photographs, instruments, appliances and <strong style="color: #e74c3c">informa tion </strong>The bulk of these statutes are found to Chapter 37 of U.S.C., Title 18, entitled “Espionage and Censorship.” In that chapter, Congress has provided penalties ranging from a $10,000 fine to death for violating the various statutes.',"Thus it would seem that in order for this Court to issue an injunction it would require a showing that such an injunction would enhance the already existing power of the Government to act. See Bennett v. Laman, 277 N. Y. 368, 14 N. E. 2d 439 (1938). It is a traditional axiom of equity that a court of equity will not do a useless thing just as it is a traditional axiom that equity will not enjoin the commission of a crime. See Z. Chaffe & E. Re, Equity 4935‐954 (5th ed. 1967); H. Joyce, injunctions sections 58‐60A, (1909). Here there has been no attempt to make such a showing. The Solicitor General does not even mention in his brief whether the Government considers there to be probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or whether there is a conspiracy to commit future crimes.",'If the Government had attempted to show that there was no effective remedy under traditional criminal law, it would have had to show that there is no arguably applicable statute. Of course, at this stage this Court could not and cannot determine whether there has been a violation of a particular statute nor decide the constitutionality of any statute. Whether a good‐faith <strong style="color: #8e44ad">prosecu tion </strong>could have been instituted under any statute could, however, be <strong style="color: #f39c12">deter mined.</strong>',"Relevant Statute Noted",'At least one of the many statutes In this area seems relevant to this case, Congress has provided in 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e) that whoever “having unauthorized possesion of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book ... or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, <strong style="color: #27ae60">trans mits </strong>... the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employe of the United States entitled to receive it ... shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.” 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e). Congress has also made it a crime to conspire to commit any of the offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e).','It is true that Judge Gurfein found that Congress had not made it a crime to publish the items and material <strong style="color: #3498db">speci fied </strong>in Section 793 <strong style="color: #e67e22">(e): He </strong>found that the words “communicates, delivers, transmits ...” did not refer to <strong style="color: #e74c3c">publi cation </strong>of newspaper stories. And that view has some support in the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">legisla tive </strong>history and conforms with the past practice of using the statute only to prosecute those charged with ordinary espionage. But see 103 Cong. Rec. 10449 (remarks of Senator Humphrey). Judge Gurfein\'s view of the statute is not, however, the only plausible construction that could be given. See my brother White\'s concurring opinion.','Even if it is determined that the Government could not in good faith bring criminal prosecutions against The New York Times and The Washington Post, it is clear that Congress has <strong style="color: #f39c12">spe cifically </strong>rejected passing legislation that would have clearly given the President the power he seeks here and made the current activity of the newspapers <strong style="color: #27ae60">un lawful. </strong>When Congress specifically <strong style="color: #3498db">de clines </strong>to make conduct unlawful it is not for this Court to redecide those issues —to overrule Congress. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer, 345 U.S. 579 (1952).','On at least two occasions Congress has refused to enact legislation that would have made the conduct engaged in here unlawful and given the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Presi dent </strong>the power that he seeks in this case. In 1917 during the debate over the original Espionage Act, still the basic provisions of Section 793, <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Con gress </strong>rejected a proposal to give the President in time of war or threat of war authority to directly prohibit by proclamation the publication of <strong style="color: #8e44ad">infor mation </strong>relating to national defense that might be useful to the enemy. The <strong style="color: #f39c12">pro posal </strong>provided that:','“During any national emergency <strong style="color: #27ae60">re sulting </strong>from a war to which the United States is a party, or from threat of such a war, the President may, by <strong style="color: #3498db">proc lamation, </strong>prohibit the publishing or <strong style="color: #e67e22">com municating </strong>of, or the attempting to publish or communicate any <strong style="color: #e74c3c">informa tion </strong>relating to the national defense which, in his judgment, is of such character that it is or might be useful to the enemy. Whoever violates any such prohibition shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by <strong style="color: #8e44ad">im prisonment </strong>for not more than 10 years, or both: provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or restrict any discussion, comment or criticism of the acts or policies of the Government or its representatives or the publication of the same.” 55 Cong. Rec. 1763.',"No Request of Congress","Congress rejected this proposal after war against Germany had been declared even though many believed that the threat of security leaks and espionage were serious. The executive has not gone to Congress and requested that the decision to provide such power be reconsidered. Instead, the executive comes to this Court and asks that it be granted the power Congress refused to give.",'In 1957 the United States Commission on Government Security fund that “air plane journals, scientific periodicals and even the daily newspaper have featured articles containing information and other data which should have been <strong style="color: #f39c12">de leted </strong>in whole or in part for security reasons.” In response to this problem the commission, which was chaired by Senator Cotton, proposed that <strong style="color: #27ae60">“Con gress </strong>enact legislation making it a crime for any person willfully to disclose without proper authorization, for any purpose whatever, information <strong style="color: #3498db">classi fied </strong>‘secret’ or ‘top secret,’ knowing, or having reasonable grounds to believe, such information to have been so <strong style="color: #e67e22">classi fied.” </strong>Report of Commission on <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Govern ment </strong>Security 619‐620 (1957).

If the proposal that Senator Cotton championed on the floor had been enacted, the publication of the documents here would certainly have been a crime. Congress refused, how ever, to make it a crime. The <strong style="color: #27ae60">Govern ment </strong>is here asking this Court to <strong style="color: #3498db">re make </strong>that decision. This court has no such power.','Either the Government has the power under statutory grant to use traditional criminal law to protect the country or, if there is no basis for arguing that Congress has made the activity a crime, it is plain that Congress has specifically refused to grant the authority the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Gov ernment </strong>seeks from this Court. In either case this Court does not have authority to grant the requested relief. It is not for this Court to fling itself into every breach perceived by some Government official, nor is it for this Court to take on itself the burden of enacting law, especially law that Congress has <strong style="color: #e74c3c">re fused </strong>to pass.',"I believe that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia should be affirmed and the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit should be reversed insofar as it remands the case for further hearings.","Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas joins, concurring.",'I adhere to the view that the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Govern ment\'s </strong>case against The Washington Post should have been dismissed and that the injunction against The New York Times should have been vacated without oral argument when the cases were first presented to this Court. I <strong style="color: #f39c12">be lieve </strong>that every moment\'s continuance of the injunctions against these news papers amounts to a flagrant, <strong style="color: #27ae60">indefen sible </strong>and continuing violation of the First Amendment. Furthermore, after oral arguments, I agree completely that we must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the. Second Circuit for the reasons stated by my brothers Douglas and Brennan. In my view it is unfortunate that some of my brethren are apparently willing to hold that the publication of news may some times be enjoined. Such a holding would make a shambles of the First <strong style="color: #3498db">Amend ment.</strong>','Our Government was launched in 1789 with the adoption of the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Consti tution. </strong>The Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment, followed in 1791. Now, for the first time in the 182 years since the founding of the Republic, the Federal courts are asked to hold that the First Amendment does not mean what it says, but rather means that the Government can halt the publication of current news of vital importance to the people of this country.','In seeking injunctions against these newspapers and in its presentation to the Court, the executive branch seems to have forgotten the essential purpose area History of the First Amendment. When the Constitution was adopted, many people strongly opposed it <strong style="color: #e74c3c">be cause </strong>the document contained no bill of rights to safeguard certain basic freedoms. They especially feared that the new powers granted to a central government might be interpreted to per mit the government to curtail freedom of religion, press, assembly and speech. In response to an overwhelming public clamor, James Madison offered a series of amendments to satisfy citizens that these great liberties would remain safe and beyond the power of government to abridge. Madison proposed what later became the First Amendment in three parts, two of which are set out below, and one of which proclaimed: “The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">free dom </strong>of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.” The amendments were offered to curtail and restrict the general powers granted to the executive, legislative and judicial branches two years before in the <strong style="color: #f39c12">orig inal </strong>Constitution. The Bill of Rights changed the original Constitution into a new charter under which no, branch of government could abridge the pebple\'s freedoms of press, speech, religion and assembly.',"‘Perversion of History’",'Yet the Solicitor General argues and some members of the Court appear to agree that the general powers of the Government adopted in the original Constitution should be interpreted to limit and restrict the specifie and <strong style="color: #27ae60">em phatic </strong>guarantees of the Bill of Rights adopted later. I can imagine no greater perversion of history. Madison and the other framers of the First Amendment, able men that they were, wrote in <strong style="color: #3498db">lan guage </strong>they earnestly believed could never be misunderstood: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of the press.” Both the history and <strong style="color: #e67e22">lan guage </strong>of the First Amendment support the view that the press must be left free to publish news, whatever the source, without censorship, injunctions or prior restraints.','In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">protec tion </strong>it must have to fulfill its essential role in our demobracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">gover nors. </strong>The Government\'s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to cen sure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the <strong style="color: #f39c12">Govern ment </strong>from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell. In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their courageous <strong style="color: #27ae60">re porting, </strong>The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly. In revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam war, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the founders hoped and trusted they would do.',"The Government's case here, is based on premises entirely different from those that guided the framers of the First Amendment. The Solicitor General has carefully and emphatically stated:",'“Now, Mr. Justice [Black], your <strong style="color: #3498db">con struction </strong>of ... [the First Amendment] is well known, and I certainly respect it. You say that no law means no law, and that should be obvious. I can only say, Mr. Justice, that to me it is equally obvious that ‘no law,’ and I would seek to persuade the Court that that is true ... [t]here are other parts of the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Con stitution </strong>that grant power and <strong style="color: #e74c3c">respon sibilities </strong>to the executive and ... the First Amendment was not intended to make it impossible for the executive to function or to protect the security of the United States.”',"Government Stand Rebutted",'And the Government argues in its brief that in spite of the First <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Amend ment, </strong>“the authority of the executive department to protect the nation against publication of information whose <strong style="color: #f39c12">dis closure </strong>would endanger the national <strong style="color: #27ae60">se curity </strong>stems from two interrelated sources: the constitutional power of the President over the conduct of foreign affairs and his authority as <strong style="color: #3498db">Command er </strong>in Chief.”','In other words, we are asked to hold that despite the First Amendment\'s <strong style="color: #e67e22">em phatic </strong>command, the executive branch, the Congress and the judiciary can make laws enjoining publication of current news and abridging freedom of the press in the name of “national security.” The Government does not even attempt to rely on act of Congress. Instead it makes the bold and dangerously far reaching contention that the courts should take it upon themselves to “make” a law abridging freedom of the press in the name of equity, Presidential power and national security, even when the representatives of the people in Congress have adhered to the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">com mand </strong>of the First Amendment and <strong style="color: #8e44ad">re fused </strong>to make such a law. See concur ring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas, Post.','To find that the President has <strong style="color: #f39c12">“in herent </strong>power” to halt the publication of news by resort to the courts would wipe out the First Amendment and <strong style="color: #27ae60">de stroy </strong>the fundamental liberty and <strong style="color: #3498db">se curity </strong>of the very people the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Govern ment </strong>hopes to make “secure.” No one can read the history of the adoption of the First Amendment without being convinced beyond any doubt that it was injunctions like those sought here that Madison and his collaborators intended to outlaw in this nation for all time.','The word “security” is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.

This thought was eloquently expressed in 1937 by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes—great man and great Chief Justice that he was— when the Court held a man could not be punished for attending a meeting run by Communists.",'“The greater the importance of safe guarding the community from incite ments to the overthrow: of our <strong style="color: #8e44ad">institu tions </strong>by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve in violate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of consti ional government.”',"Mr. Justice White, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart joins, concurring.",'I concur in today\'s judgments, but only because of the concededly <strong style="color: #f39c12">extraor dinary </strong>protection against prior, <strong style="color: #27ae60">re straints </strong>enjoyed by the press under our constitutional system. I do not say that in no circumstances would the First Amendment permit an injunction against publishing information about Government plans or operations. Nor, after examining the materials the <strong style="color: #3498db">Gov ernment </strong>characterizes as the most sensitive and destructive, can I deny that revelation of these documents will do substantial damage to public <strong style="color: #e67e22">inter ests. </strong>Indeed, I am confident that their disclosure will have that result. But I nevertheless agree that the United States has, not satisfied the very heavy burden, which it must meet to warrant an injuction against publication in these cases, at least in the absence of express and appropriately limited Congressional authorization for prior restraints in circumstances such as these.','The Government\'s position if simply stated: The responsibility of the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">execu tive </strong>for the conduct of the foreign affairs and for the security of the nation is so basic that the President is entitled to an injunction against <strong style="color: #8e44ad">pub lication </strong>of a newspaper story whenever he can convince a court that the <strong style="color: #f39c12">infor mation </strong>to be revealed threatens “grave and irreparable” injury to the public interest; and the injunction should issue whether or not the material to be published is classified, whether or not publication would be lawful under relevant criminal statutes enacted by Congress and regardless of the <strong style="color: #27ae60">circum stances </strong>by which the newspaper came into possession of the information.','At least in the absence of legislation by Congress, based on its own <strong style="color: #3498db">investi gations </strong>and findings, I am quite unable to agree that the inherent powers of the executive and the courts reach so far as to authorize remedies having such sweeping potential for inhibiting publications by the press. Much of the difficulty inheres in the “grave and irreparable danger” standard <strong style="color: #e67e22">suggest ed </strong>by the United States. If the. United States were to have judgment under such a standard in these cases, our decision would be of little guidance to other courts in other cases, for the material at issue here would not be available from the Court\'s opinion or from public records, nor would it be published by the press. Indeed, even today where we hold that the United States has not met its burden, the material remains sealed in court <strong style="color: #e74c3c">rec ords </strong>and it is properly not discussed in today\'s opinions. Moreover, because the, material poses substantial dangers to national interests and because of the hazards of criminal sanctions, a responsible press may choose never to publish the more sensitive materials. To sustain the Government in these cases would start the courts down a long and hazardous road that I am not willing to travel, at least without <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Con gressional </strong>guidance and direction.',"‘Not Easy to Deny Relief’",'It is not easy to reject the proposition urged by the United. States and to deny relief on its good‐faith claims in these cases that publication will work serious damage to the country. But that <strong style="color: #f39c12">dis comfiture </strong>is considerably dispelled by the infrequency of prior restraint cases. Normally, publication will occur and the damage be done before the Government has either opportunity or grounds for suppression. So here, publication has already begun and a substantial part of the threatened damage has already occurred. The fact of a massive break down in security is known, access to the documents by many unauthorizes people is undeniable and the efficacy of equitable relief against these or other newspapers to avert anticipated damage is doubtful at best.','What is more, terminating the ban on publication of the relatively few <strong style="color: #27ae60">sen sitive </strong>documents the Government now seeks to suppress does not mean that the law either requires or invites news papers or others to publish them or that they will be immune from criminal <strong style="color: #3498db">ac tion </strong>if they do. Prior restraints require an unusually heavy justification under the First Amendment; but failure by the Government to justify prior <strong style="color: #e67e22">re straints </strong>does not measure its <strong style="color: #e74c3c">constitu tional </strong>entitlement to a conviction for criminal publication. That the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Govern ment </strong>mistakenly chose to proceed by injunction does not mean that it could not successfully proceed in another way.','When the Espionage Act was under consideration in 1917, Congress <strong style="color: #f39c12">elimi nated </strong>from the bill a provision that would have given the President broad powers in time of war to proscribe, under threat of criminal penalty, the publication of various categories of <strong style="color: #27ae60">in formation </strong>related to the national <strong style="color: #3498db">de fense. </strong>Congress at that time was <strong style="color: #e67e22">unwill ing </strong>to clothe the President with such far‐reaching powers to monitor the press, and those opposed to this part of the legislation assumed that a <strong style="color: #e74c3c">neces sary </strong>concomitant of such power was the power to “filter out the news to the people through some man.” 55 Cong. Rec. 2008 (1917) (remarks of Senator Ashurst). However, these same <strong style="color: #8e44ad">mem bers </strong>of Congress appeared to have little doubt that newspapers would be subject to criminal prosecution if they insisted on publishing information of the type Congress had itself determined should not be revealed. Senator Ashurst, for example, was quite sure that the editor of such a newspaper (“should be punished if he did publish information as to the movements of the fleet, the troops, the aircraft, the location of powder <strong style="color: #f39c12">facto ries, </strong>the location of defense works and all that sort of thing.” 55 Cong. Rec. 2009 (1917).','The Criminal Code contains numerous provisions potentially relevant to these cases. Section 797 makes it a crime to publish certain photographs or drawings of military installations.

If any of the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">mate rial </strong>here at issue is of this nature, the newspapers are presumably now on full notice of the position of the United States and must face the consequences if they publish. I would have no <strong style="color: #8e44ad">diffi culty </strong>in sustaining convictions under these sections on facts that would not Justify the intervention of equity and the imposition of a prior restraint.',"Under ‘a Wider Net’",'The same would be true under those sections of the Criminal Code casting a wider net to protect thee national <strong style="color: #f39c12">de fense. </strong>Section 798 (e) makes it a <strong style="color: #27ae60">crimi nal </strong>act for any unauthorized possessor of a document “relating to national <strong style="color: #3498db">de fense” </strong>either (1) willfully to <strong style="color: #e67e22">communi cate </strong>or cause to be communicated that document to any person not entitled to receive it or (2) willfully to retain the document and fail to deliver it to an officer of the United States entitled to receive it. The subsection was added in 1950 because pre‐existing law provided no penalty for the unauthorized <strong style="color: #e74c3c">pos sessor </strong>unless demand for the documents was made. “The dangers surrounding the unauthorized possession of such items; are self‐evident, and it is deemed advisable to require their surrender in such a case, regardless of demand, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">es pecially </strong>since their, unauthorized pos session may be unknown to the <strong style="color: #f39c12">authori ties </strong>who would otherwise make the <strong style="color: #27ae60">de mand.” </strong>S. Rep. No. 2369, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1950). Of course, in the cases before us, the unpublished documents have been demanded by the United States and their import has been made known at least to counsel for the news papers involved. In Gorin v. United States, 312 U. S. 19, 28 (1941), the words “national defense” as used in a predecessor of Sec. 793, were held by a unanimous court to have “a well‐under stood connotation”—a “generic concept of broad connotations, referring to the military and naval establishments and the related activities of national <strong style="color: #3498db">pre paredness”—</strong>and to be “sufficiently <strong style="color: #e67e22">defi nite </strong>to apprise the public of prohibited activities” and to be consonant with due process. 312 U.

Also, as <strong style="color: #e74c3c">con strued </strong>by the Court in Gorin, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">informa tion </strong>“connected with the national <strong style="color: #f39c12">de fense” </strong>is obviously not limited to that threatening “grave and irreparable” <strong style="color: #27ae60">in jury </strong>to the United States.','It is thus clear that Congress has addressed itself to the problems of <strong style="color: #3498db">pro tecting </strong>the security of the country and the national defense from unauthorized disclosure of potentially damaging formation. Cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585‐586 (1952): see also id., at 593.628 <strong style="color: #e67e22">(Frank furter, </strong>J., concurring). Lt has not, how ever, authorized the injunctive remedy against threatened publication. It has apparently been satisfied to rely on criminal sanctions and their deterrent effect on the responsible as well as the irresponsible press. I am not, of course, saying that either of these newspapers has yet committed a crime or that either would commit a crime if they published all the material now in their possession. That matter must await resolution in the context of a criminal proceeding one is instituted by the United States. In that event, the issue of guilt or <strong style="color: #e74c3c">inno cence </strong>would be determined by <strong style="color: #8e44ad">proce dures </strong>and standards quite different from those that have purported to govern these injunctive proceedings.',"Dissents",'Mr. Chief Justice Burger, <strong style="color: #f39c12">dissent ing.</strong>','So clear are the constitutional <strong style="color: #27ae60">limita tions </strong>on prior restraint against <strong style="color: #3498db">expres sion, </strong>that from the time of Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697 (1931), until recently in Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, (1971), we have had little occasion to be concerned with cases involving prior restraints against news reporting on matters of public interest. There is, therefore, little <strong style="color: #e67e22">vari ation </strong>among the members of the Court in terms of resistance to prior restraints against publication. Adherence to this basic constitutional principle, however, does not make this case a simple one. In this case, the imperative of a free and unfettered press comes into <strong style="color: #e74c3c">colli sion </strong>with another imperative, the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">effec tive </strong>functioning of a complex modern government, and specifically the <strong style="color: #f39c12">effec tive </strong>exercise of certain constitutional powers of the executive. Only those who view the First Amendment as an absolute in all circumstances—a View I respect, but reject—can find such a case as this to be simple or easy.',"This case is not simple for another and more immediate reason. We do not know the facts of the case. No District Judge knew all type facts. No Court of Appeals Judge knew all the facts. No member of this Court knows all the facts.","Why are we in this posture, in which only those judges to whom the First Amendment is absolute and permits of no restraint in any circumstances or for any reason, are really in a position to act?",'I suggest we, are in this pasture <strong style="color: #27ae60">be cause </strong>these cases have been conducted in unseemly haste. Mr. Justice Harlin covers the chronology of events <strong style="color: #3498db">demon strating </strong>the hectic pressures under which these cases have been processed and I need not restate them; The prompt setting of these cases reflects our pni vessel abhorrence of prior restraint. But prompt judicial action does not mean unjudicial haste.','Here, moreover, the frenetic haste is due in large part to the manner in which The Times proceeded from the date it obtained the purloined <strong style="color: #e67e22">docu ments. </strong>It seems reasonably clear now that the haste precluded reasonable and deliberate judicial treatment of these cases and was not warranted. The <strong style="color: #e74c3c">pre cipitous </strong>action of this court aborting a trial not yet completed is not the kind of judicial conduct which ought to attend the disposition of a great issue.',"‘The Public Right to Know’",'The newspapers make a derivative claim under the First Amendment they, denominate this right as the public right to know; by implication. The Times asserts a sole trusteeship of that right by virtue of its journalist “scoop.” The right is asserted as an absolute. Of course, the First Amendment right itself is not an absolute, as Justice Holmes so long Ago pointed out in his aphorism concerning the right to shout of fire in a crowded theater. There are other <strong style="color: #8e44ad">ex ceptions, </strong>some of which Chief Justice Hughes mentioned by way, of example in Near v. Minnesota. There are no doubt other exceptions no one has had occasion to describe or discuss. <strong style="color: #f39c12">Con ceivably </strong>such exceptions may be lurking in these cases and would have been flushed had they been properly <strong style="color: #27ae60">consid ered </strong>in the trial courts, free from <strong style="color: #3498db">un warranted </strong>deadlines and frenetic <strong style="color: #e67e22">pres sures.</strong>',"A great issue of this kind should be tried in a judicial atmosphere conducive to thoughtful, reflective deliberation, especially when haste, in terms of hours, is unwarranted in light of the long period The Times, by its own choice, deferred publication.",'It is not disputed that The Times has had unauthorized possession of the documents for three to four months, during which it has had its expert analysts studying them, presumably digesting them and preparing the material for publication. During all of this time, The Times, presumably in its capacity as trustee of the public\'s “right, to know,” has held up <strong style="color: #e74c3c">publica tion </strong>for purposes it considered proper and thus public knowledge was delayed. No doubt this was for a good reason; the analysis of 7,000 pages of complex material drawn from a vastly greater volume of material would inevitably take time and the writing of good news stories takes time.','But why should the United States Government, from whom this <strong style="color: #8e44ad">informa tion </strong>was illegally acquired by someone, along with all the counsel, trial judges, and appellate judges be placed under needless pressure? After these months of deferral, the alleged right to know has somehow and suddenly become a right that must be vindicated instanter.','Would it have been unreasonable, since the newspaper could anticipate the Government\'s objections to release of secret material, to give the <strong style="color: #f39c12">Govern ment </strong>an opportunity to review the <strong style="color: #27ae60">en tire </strong>collection and determine whether agreement could be reached on publica tion? Stolen or not, if security was not in fact jeopardized, much of the material could no doubt have been declassified, since it spans a period ending in 1968.',"‘Duty of Honorable Press’",'With such an approach—one that great newspapers have in the past <strong style="color: #3498db">prac ticed </strong>and stated editorially to be the duty of honorable press—the <strong style="color: #e67e22">newspa pers </strong>and Government might well have narrowed the area of disagreement as to what was and was not publishable, leaving the remainder to be resolved in orderly litigation if necessary. To me it is hardly believable that a newspaper long regarded as a great institution in American life would fail to perform one of the basic and simple duties of every citizen with respect to the discovery or possession of stolen property or secret Government documents. That duty, I had thought—perhaps naively—was to report forthwith, to responsible public officers. This duty rests on taxi drivers, justices and The New York Times. The course followed by The Times, whether so calculated or not, removed any <strong style="color: #e74c3c">possi bility </strong>of orderly litigation of the issues. If the action of the judges up to now has been correct, that result is sheer happenstance.',"Our grant of the writ before final judgment in The Times cage aborted the trial in the District Court before it had made a complete record pursuant to the mandate of the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.",'The consequences of all this <strong style="color: #8e44ad">melan choly </strong>series of events is that we <strong style="color: #f39c12">liter ally </strong>do not know what we are acting on. As I see it we have been forced to deal with litigation concerning rights of great magnitude without an adequate record, and surely without time for adequate treatment either in the prior proceedings or in this court. It is <strong style="color: #27ae60">in teresting </strong>to note that counsel in oral argument before this Court were <strong style="color: #3498db">fre quently </strong>unable to respond to questions on factual points. Not surprisingly they pointed out that they had been <strong style="color: #e67e22">work ing </strong>literally “around the clock” and simply were unable to review the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">docu ments </strong>that give rise to these cases and were not familiar with them. This Court is in no better posture. I agree with Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Black mun but I am not prepared to reach the merits.','I would affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and allow the District Court to complete the trial aborted by our grant of certiorari, mean while preserving the status quo in The Post case. I would direct that the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Dis trict </strong>Court on remand give priority to The Times case to the exclusion of all other business of that court but I would not set arbitrary deadlines.','I should add that I am in general agreement with much of what Mr. <strong style="color: #f39c12">Jus tice </strong>White has expressed with respect to, penal sanctions concerning <strong style="color: #27ae60">commu nication </strong>or retention of documents or information relating to the national defense.','We all crave speedier judicial <strong style="color: #3498db">proc esses, </strong>but when judges are pressured as in these cases the result is a parody of the judicial process.','Mr. Justice Harlan, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. <strong style="color: #e67e22">Jus tice </strong>Blackmun join, dissenting.','These cases forcefully call to mind the wise admonition of Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting in Northern <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Secu rities </strong>Co. v.

These immediate interests exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes what previously was clear seem doubtful, and before which even, well settled princinles of law will bend.”',"With all respect, I consider that the Court has been almost irresponsibly feverish in dealing with these cases.",'Both the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Ciruit rendered judgment on June 23.

Whether the Attorney General is authorized to bring these suits in the name of the United States. Compare In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895), with Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 479 (1952). This <strong style="color: #e74c3c">ques tion </strong>involves as well the construction and validity of a singularly opaque statute—the Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e).','2. Whether the First Amendment <strong style="color: #8e44ad">per mits </strong>the Federal Courts to enjoin <strong style="color: #f39c12">publi cation </strong>of stories which would present a serious threat to national security, See Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931) (dictum).','3. Whether the threat to publish highly secret documents is of itself a sufficient implication of national <strong style="color: #27ae60">secu rity </strong>to justify an injunction on the theory that regardless of the contents of the documents harm enough results simply from the demonstration of such a breach of secrecy.','4. Whether the unauthorized <strong style="color: #3498db">dis closure </strong>of any of these particular <strong style="color: #e67e22">docu ments </strong>would seriously impair the national security.',"5. What weight should be given to the opinion of high officers in the executive branch of the. Government with respect to questions 3 and 4.",'6. Whether the newspapers are <strong style="color: #e74c3c">en titled </strong>to retain and use the documents notwithstanding the seemingly <strong style="color: #8e44ad">uncon tested </strong>facts that the documents, or the original of which they are duplicates, were purloined from the Government\'s possession and that the newspapers received them with the knowledge that they had been feloniously acquired. Cf. Liberty Lobby, Inc., v. Pearson, 390 F. 2d 489 (CADC 1968).','7. Whether the threatened harm to, the national security or the <strong style="color: #f39c12">Govern ment\'s </strong>possessory interest in the <strong style="color: #27ae60">docu ments </strong>justifies the issuance of an injunction against publication in light of—','A. The strong First Amendment policy against prior restraints on <strong style="color: #3498db">pub lication:</strong>','B. The doctrine against enjoining <strong style="color: #e67e22">con duct </strong>in violation of criminal statutes; and',"C. The extent to which the materials at issue have apparently already been otherwise disseminated.","‘Difficult Questions of Fact, Law’",'These are difficult questions of fact, of law and of judgment; the potential Consequences of erroneous decision are enormous. The time which has been available to us, to the lower courts and to the parties has been wholly <strong style="color: #e74c3c">inade quate </strong>for giving these cases the kind of consideration they deserve. It is a reflection on the stability of the judicial prdcess that these great issues—as <strong style="color: #8e44ad">im portant </strong>as any that have arisen during my time on the Court—should have been decided under the pressures engendered by the torrent of publicity that has attended these litigations from their inception.',"Forced as I am to reach the merits of these cases, I dissent from the opinion and judgments of the Court. Within the severe limitations imposed by the time constraints under which I have been required to operate, I can only state my reasons in telescoped form, even though in different circumstances I would have felt constrained to deal with the cases in the fuller sweep indicated above.",'It is a sufficient basis for affirming the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in The Times litigation to <strong style="color: #f39c12">ob serve </strong>that its order must rest on the conclusion that because of the time elements the Government had not been given an adequate opportunity to <strong style="color: #27ae60">pre sent </strong>its case to the District Court. At the least this conclusion was not an abuse of discretion.','In The Post litigation the Government had more time to prepare; this was apparently the basis for the refusal of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on reheating to conform its judgment to that of the Second Circuit But I think there is another and more fundamental reason why this judgment cannot stand—a reason which also furnishes an <strong style="color: #3498db">addi tional </strong>ground for not reinstating the judgment of the district court in The Times litigation, set aside by the Court of Appeals. It is plain to me that the scope of the judicial function in passing upon the activities of the executive branch of the Government in the field of foreign affairs is very narrowly <strong style="color: #e67e22">re stricted. </strong>This view is, I think, dictated by the concept of separation of powers upon which our constitutional system rests.',"In a speech on the floor of the House of. Representatives, Chief Justice John Marshall, then a member of that body, stated:","“The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and a its sole representative with foreign nations.” Annals, 6th Cong., Col. 613 (1800).","From that time, shortly after the founding of the nation, to this, there has been no substantial challenge to this description of the scope of executive power. See United States v. Curtiss Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319‐321 (1936), collecting authorities.",'From this constitutional primacy in the field of foreign affairs, it seems to me that certain conclusions necessarily follow. Some of these were stated <strong style="color: #e74c3c">con cisely </strong>by President Washington, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">declin ing </strong>the request of the House of <strong style="color: #f39c12">Repre sentatives </strong>for the papers leading up to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty:',"“The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy; and even when brought to a conclusion a full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions which may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely impolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations, or produce immediate in conveniences, perhaps danger and mis chief, in relation to other powers.” J. Richardson, “Messages and Papers of the Presidents” 194‐195 (1899).","Need for Judicial Review Seen",'The power to evaluate the “pernicious influence” of premature disclosure is not, however, lodged in the executive alone. I agree that, in performance of its duty to protect the values of the First Amendmen against political <strong style="color: #27ae60">pres sures, </strong>the judiciary must review the initial executive determination to the point of satisfying itself that the subject matter of the dispute does lie within the proper compass of the President\'s <strong style="color: #3498db">for eign </strong>relations power. Constitutional <strong style="color: #e67e22">con siderations </strong>forbid “a complete abandon ment of judicial control.” Cf. United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 8 (1953). Moreover, the judiciary may properly insist that the determination that disclosure of the subject matter would irreparably impair the national security be made by the head of the executive department concerned —here the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense—after actual personal <strong style="color: #e74c3c">con sideration </strong>by that office. This safe guard is required in the analogous area of executive claims of privilege for <strong style="color: #8e44ad">se crets </strong>of state. See United States v. Reynolds, supra, at 8 <strong style="color: #f39c12">and N. </strong>20; Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., (1942) A. C. 624, 638 (House of Lords).','But in my judgment the judiciary may not properly go beyond these two <strong style="color: #27ae60">in quiries </strong>and redetermine for itself the probable impact of disclosure on the national security.','“The very nature of executive deci cisins as to foreign policy is political, not judicial. Such decisions are wholly confided by our Constitution to the <strong style="color: #3498db">polit ical </strong>departments of the Government, executive and legislative. They are <strong style="color: #e67e22">deli cate, </strong>complex, and involve large <strong style="color: #e74c3c">ele ment\'s </strong>of prophecy. They are and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil. They are <strong style="color: #8e44ad">deci sions </strong>of a kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor <strong style="color: #f39c12">re sponsibility </strong>and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.” Chicago & Southern Air Lines v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948) (Jackson, J.).','Even if there is some room for the judiciary to override the executive <strong style="color: #27ae60">deter mination, </strong>it is plain that the scope of review must he exceedingly narrow. I can see no indication in the opinions of either the District Court or the Court of Appeals in The Post litigation that the conclusions of the executive were given even the deference owing to an administrative agency, much less that owing to a coequal constitutional <strong style="color: #3498db">pre rogative.</strong>','Accordingly, I would vacate the <strong style="color: #e67e22">judg ment </strong>of the Court of Appeals for the, District of Columbia Circuit on this ground and remand the case for further proceedings in the District Court. Before the commencement of such further <strong style="color: #e74c3c">pro ceedings, </strong>due opportunity should be afforded the Government for procuring from the Secretary of State or the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Sec retary </strong>of Defense or both an expression of their views on the issue of national security. The ensuing review by the District Court should be in accordance with the views expressed in this <strong style="color: #f39c12">opin ion. </strong>And for the reasons stated above I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.','Pending further hearings in each case conducted under the appropriate ground rules, I would continue the restraints on publication. I cannot believe that the doctrine prohibiting prior restraints reaches to the point of preventing courts from maintaining the status quo long enough to act responsibly in <strong style="color: #27ae60">mat ters </strong>of such national importance as those involved here.',"Mr. Justice Blackmun.","I join Mr. Justice Harlan in his dis sent. I also am in substantial accord with much that Mr. Justice White says, by way of admonition, in the latter part of his opinion.",'At this point the focus is on only the comparatively few documents <strong style="color: #3498db">speci fied </strong>by the Government as critical. So far as the other material — vast in amount—is concerned, let it be <strong style="color: #e67e22">pub lished </strong>and published forthwith if the newspapers, once the strain is gone and the sensationalism is eased, still feel the urge so to do.','But we are concerned here with the few documents specified from the 47 volumes. Almost 70 years ago Mr. <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Jus tice </strong>Holmes, dissenting in a celebrated case, observed:','“Great cases like hard cases make bad law.

Once it had begun publication of material from those volumes, the New York case now before us emerged. It immediately as sullied, and ever since has maintained, a frenetic pace and character. Seemingly, once publication started, the material could not be made public fast enough. Seemingly, from then on, every deferral or delay, by restraint or otherwise, was abhorrent and was to be deemed viola tive of the First Amendment and of the public\'s “right immediately to know.” Yet that newspaper stood before us at oral argument and professed:, criticism of the Government for not lodging its protest earlier than by a Monday tele gram following the initial Sunday pub libation.',"The District of Columbia case is much the same.","‘Pressed Into Hurried Decision’",'Two Federal District Courts, two United States Courts of Appeals, and this Court—within a period of less than three weeks from inception until today —have been pressed into hurried <strong style="color: #e74c3c">de cision </strong>of profound constitutional issues on inadequately developed and largely assumed facts without the careful <strong style="color: #8e44ad">de liberation </strong>that, hopefully, should <strong style="color: #f39c12">charac terize </strong>the American judicial process. There has been much writing about the law and little knowledge and less <strong style="color: #27ae60">diges tion </strong>of the facts. In the New York case the judges, both trial and appellate, had not yet examined the basic material when the case was brought here. In the District of Columbia case, little more was done, and what was accomplished in this respect was only on required <strong style="color: #3498db">re mand, </strong>with The Washington Post, on the excuse that it was trying to protect its source of information, initially refusing to reveal what material it actually <strong style="color: #e67e22">pos sessed, </strong>and with the District Court forced to make assumptions as to that possession.','With such respect as may be due to the contrary view, this, in my opinion, is not the way to try a law suit of this magnitude and asserted <strong style="color: #e74c3c">im portance. </strong>It is not the way for Federal Courts to adjudicate, and to be <strong style="color: #8e44ad">re quired </strong>to adjudicate, issues that <strong style="color: #f39c12">al legedly </strong>concern the nation\'s vital <strong style="color: #27ae60">wel fare. </strong>The country would be none the worse off were the cases tried quickly, to be sure, but in the customary and properly deliberative manner. The most recent of the material, it is said, date, no later than 1968, already about three years ago, and The Times itself took three months to formulate its plan of procedure and, thus, deprived its public for that period.',"The First Amendment, after all, is only one part of an entire Constitution. Article II of the great document vests in the executive branch primary power over the conduct of foreign affairs and places in that branch the responsibility for the nation's safety.","Each provision of the Constitution is important, and I cannot subscribe to a doctrine of unlimited absolutism for the First Amendment at the cost of downgrading other provisions.",'First Amendment absolutism has never commanded a majority of this court. See, for example, Near v. <strong style="color: #3498db">Min nesota, </strong>283 U.S. 697, 708 (1931), and Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919). What IT needed here is weighing, upon properly developed standards, of the broad right of the press to print and of the very narrow right of the Government to prevent. Such standards are not yet developed. The parties here are in disagreement as to what those standards should be. But even the newspapers concede that there are situations where restraint in order and is constitutional. Mr. <strong style="color: #e67e22">Jus tice </strong>Holmes gave us a suggestion when he said in Schenck:',"“It is a question of proximity and degree.

Section 793 (e) provides that “whoever having <strong style="color: #e67e22">unauthorized </strong>possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, ... or information relating to the national defense which information the posses sor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, wilfully communicates ... the same to any person not entitled to receive it ... shall be fined not more than $10, 000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years or both.”',"The Government suggests that the word, “communicates” is broad enough to encompass publication.",'There are eight sections in the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">chapter </strong>on espionage and censorship, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Sections </strong>792‐799. In three of those eight, “publish” is specifically mentioned: <strong style="color: #f39c12">Section </strong>794 (b) provides, “Whoever in time of war, with the intent that the same shall be communicated to the enemy, collects records, publishes, or <strong style="color: #27ae60">communicates </strong>...

That version read: “During any national emergency resulting from a war to which the U.S. is a party or from threat of such a war, the President may, by proclamation, prohibit the publishing or <strong style="color: #e74c3c">communicating </strong>of, or the attempting to publish, or communicate, any information relating to the national defense, which in his judgment is of such character that it is or might be useful to the enemy.” During the debates in the Senate the First Amendment was specifically cited and that provision was defeated. 55 Cong. Rec. 2166.',"Judge Gurfein's holding in The Times case that this act does not apply to this case was therefore pre‐eminently sound. Moreover, the act of Sept. 23, 1950, in amending 18 U.S.C. Section 793, states in Section 1 (b) that:",'“Nothing in this act shall be <strong style="color: #8e44ad">construed </strong>to authorize, require, or establish military or civilian censorship or in any way to limit or infringe upon freedom of the press or of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and no regulation shall be promulgated hereunder having that effect.” 64 Stat. 987.',"Thus Congress has been faithful to the command of the First Amendment in this area.","So any power, that the Government possesses must come from its “inherent power.”",'The power to wage war is “the power to wage war successfully.” See <strong style="color: #f39c12">Hirabayashi </strong>v.

But that is no basis for <strong style="color: #e74c3c">sanctioning </strong>a previous restraint on the press. As stated by Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 719‐ 720:','“...While reckless assaults upon <strong style="color: #8e44ad">public </strong>men, and efforts to bring obloquy upon those who are endeavoring faith fully to discharge official duties, exert a baleful influence and deserve <strong style="color: #f39c12">these </strong>verest condemnation in public opinion, it cannot be said that this abuse is greater, and it is believed to be less, than that which characterized the <strong style="color: #27ae60">period </strong>in which our institutions took shape. Meanwhile, the administration of <strong style="color: #3498db">government </strong>has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and <strong style="color: #e67e22">corruption </strong>have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its protection by <strong style="color: #e74c3c">unfaithful </strong>officials and of the impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and <strong style="color: #8e44ad">official </strong>neglect, emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press, especially in great cities. The fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint in dealing with official mis conduct.”','As we stated only the other day in Organization for a Better. Austin v. Keefe, “any pnior restraint on <strong style="color: #f39c12">expression </strong>comes to this court with a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.”','The Government says that it has <strong style="color: #27ae60">inherent </strong>powers to go into court and obtain an injunction to protect that national interest, which in this case is alleged to be national security.',"Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, repudiated that expansive doctrine in no uncertain terms.",'The dominant purpose of the First Amendment was to prohibit the wide spread practice of governmental <strong style="color: #3498db">suppression </strong>of embarrassing information. It is common knowledge that the First Amendment was adopted against the widespread use of the common law of seditious libel to punish the <strong style="color: #e67e22">dissemination </strong>of material that is embarrassing to the powers‐that‐be. See Emerson, “The System of Free Expressions,” C. XIII (1941). The present cases will, I think, go down in history as the most <strong style="color: #e74c3c">dramatic </strong>illustration of that principle. A debate of large proportions goes on in the nation over our posture in Vietnam. That debate antedated the disclosure of the contents of the present documents. The latter are highly relevant to the debate in progress.','Secrecy in government is <strong style="color: #8e44ad">fundamentally </strong>antidemocratic, perpetuating bu reaticratic errors. Open debate and discussion of public issues are vital to our national health. On public questions there should be “open and robust debate.” New York Times, Inc. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 269‐270.',"I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in The Post case, vacate the stay of the Court of Appeals in The Times case and direct that it affirm the District Court.","The stays in these cases that have been in effect for more that a week constitute a flouting of the principles of the First Amendment as interpreted in Near v. Minnesota.","Mr. Justice Brennan, concurring.","I",'I write separately in these cases only to emphasize what should be apparent: that our judgment in the present cases may not be taken to indicate the <strong style="color: #f39c12">propriety, </strong>in the future, of issuing temporary stays and restraining orders to block the publication of material sought to be suppressed by the Government. So far as I can determine, never before has the United States sought to enjoin a news paper from publishing information in its possession. The relative novelty of the questions presented, the necessary haste with which decisions were reached, the magnitude of the interests asserted, and the fact that all the parties have concentrated their arguments upon the question whether permanent <strong style="color: #27ae60">restraints </strong>were proper may have justified at least some of the restraints hereto fore imposed in these cases. Certainly it is difficult to fault the several courts below for seeking to assure that the issues here involved were preserved for ultimate review by this Court. But even if it be assumed that some of the interim restraints were proper in the two cases before us, that assumption has no <strong style="color: #3498db">bearing </strong>upon the propriety of similar <strong style="color: #e67e22">judicial </strong>action in the future. To begin with, there has now been ample time for reflection and judgment; whatever <strong style="color: #e74c3c">values </strong>there may be in the preservation of novel questions for appellate review may not support any restraints in the future. More important, the First Amendment stands as an absolute bar to the imposition of judicial restraints in circumstances of the kind presented by these cases.',"II",'The error which has pervaded these cases from the outset was the granting of any injunctive relief whatsoever, interim or otherwise. The entire thrust of the Government\'s claim throughout these cases has been that publication of the material sought to be enjoined “could,” or “might” or “may” prejudice the national interest in various ways. But the First Amendment tolerates <strong style="color: #8e44ad">absolutely </strong>no prior judicial restraints of the press predicated upon surmise or conjecture that untoward consequences may result. Our cases, it is true, have indicated that there is a single, <strong style="color: #f39c12">extremely </strong>narrow class of cases Pa which the First Amendment\'s ban on prior judicial restraint may be overriden. Our cases have thus far indicated that such cases may arise only when the nation “is at war,” Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919), during which times “no one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting <strong style="color: #27ae60">service </strong>or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops.” Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931). Even if the present world situation were assumed to be tantamount to a time of war, or if the power of presently available <strong style="color: #3498db">armaments </strong>would justify even in peace time the suppression of information that would set in motion a nuclear holocaust, in neither of these actions has the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Government </strong>presented or even alleged that publication of items from or based upon the material at issue would cause the happening of an event of that nature. “The chief purpose of [the First <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Amendment\'s] </strong>guarantee [is] to prevent <strong style="color: #8e44ad">previous </strong>restraints upon publication.” Near v. Minnesota, supra, at 713. Thus, only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly and immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can <strong style="color: #f39c12">support </strong>even the issuance of an interim restraining order. In no event may mere conclusions be sufficient: for if the executive branch seeks judicial aid in preventing publication, it must <strong style="color: #27ae60">inevitably </strong>submit the basis upon which that aid is sought to scrutiny by the judiciary. And, therefore, every restraint issued in this case, whatever its form, has violated the First Amendment— and none the less so because that <strong style="color: #3498db">restraint </strong>was justified as necessary to afford the Court an opportunity to <strong style="color: #e67e22">examine </strong>the claim more thoroughly. <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Unless </strong>and until the Government has clearly made out its case, the First Amendment commands that no <strong style="color: #8e44ad">injunction </strong>may issues.','Mr. Justice Stewart, with whom Mr. Justice White joins, <strong style="color: #f39c12">concurring.</strong>','In the governmental structure created by our Constitution, the executive is <strong style="color: #27ae60">endowed </strong>with enormous power in the two related areas of national defense and international relations. This power, largely unchecked by the legislative and judicial branches, has been pressed to the very hilt since the advent of the <strong style="color: #3498db">nuclear </strong>missile age. For better or for worse, the simple fact is that a <strong style="color: #e67e22">President </strong>of the United States possesses vastly greater constitutional <strong style="color: #e74c3c">independence </strong>in these two vital areas of power than does, say, a prime minister of a country with a parliamentary form of government.','In the absence of the governmental checks and balances present in other areas of our national life, the only <strong style="color: #8e44ad">effective </strong>restraint upon executive policy and power in the areas of national defense and international affairs may lie in an enlightened citizenry— in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of <strong style="color: #f39c12">democratic </strong>government. For this reason, it is perhaps here that a press that is alert, aware, and free most vitally serves the basic purpose of the First Amendment. For without an informed and free press there cannot be an enlightened people.','Yet it is elementary that the <strong style="color: #27ae60">successful </strong>conduct of international diplomacy and the maintenance of an effective <strong style="color: #3498db">national </strong>defense require both <strong style="color: #e67e22">confidentiality </strong>and secrecy. Other nations can hardly deal with this nation in an <strong style="color: #e74c3c">atmosphere </strong>of mutual trust unless they can be assured that their confidences will be kept. And within our own <strong style="color: #8e44ad">executive </strong>departments, the development of considered and intelligent international policies would be impossible if those charged with their formulation could not communicate with each other <strong style="color: #f39c12">freely, </strong>frankly and in confidence. In the area of basic national defense the <strong style="color: #27ae60">frequent </strong>need for absolute secrecy is, of course, self‐evident.','I think there can be but one answer to this dilemma, if dilemma it be. The responsibility must be where the power is. If the Constitution gives the <strong style="color: #3498db">executive </strong>a large degree of unshared power in the conduct of foreign affairs and the maintenance of our national defense, then under the Constitution the <strong style="color: #e67e22">executive </strong>must have the largely unshared duty to determine and preserve the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">degree </strong>of internal security necessary to exercise that power successfully. It is an awesome responsibility, requiring judgment and wisdom of a high order. I should suppose that moral, political and practical considerations would <strong style="color: #8e44ad">dictate </strong>that a very first principle of that wisdom would be an insistence upon avoiding secrecy for its own sake.',"If Everything, Then Nothing",'For when everything is classified, then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless, and to be <strong style="color: #f39c12">manipulated </strong>by those intent on self‐protec tion or self‐promotion. I should suppose in short, that the hallmark of a truly effective international security system would be the maximum possible <strong style="color: #27ae60">disclosure, </strong>recognizing that secrecy can best be preserved only when <strong style="color: #3498db">credibility </strong>is truly maintained. But be that as it may, it is clear to me that it is the constitutional duty of the executive —as a matter of sovereign perogative and not as a matter of law as the courts know law—through the promulgation and enforcement of executive <strong style="color: #e67e22">regulations, </strong>to protect the confidentiality <strong style="color: #e74c3c">necessary </strong>to carry out its responsibilities in the fields of international relations national defense.','This is not to say that Congress and the courts have no role to play. <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Undoubtedly </strong>Congress has the power to enact specific and appropriate criminal laws to protect Government property and preserve Government secrets. Congress has passed such laws, and several of them are of very colorable relevance to the apparent circumstances of these cases, and if a criminal prosecution is instituted, it will be the responsibility of the courts to decide the applicability of the criminal law under which the charge is brought. Moreover, if Congress should pass a specific law authorizing civil proceedings in this field, the courts would likewise have the duty to decide the constitutionality of such a law as well as its applicability to the facts proved.','But in the cases before us we are asked neither to construe specific <strong style="color: #f39c12">regulations </strong>nor to apply specific laws. We are asked, instead, to perform a <strong style="color: #27ae60">function </strong>that the Constitution gave to the executive, not the judiciary. We are asked, quite simply, to prevent the publication by two newspapers of <strong style="color: #3498db">material </strong>that the executive branch insists should not, in the national interest, be published. I arm convinced that the <strong style="color: #e67e22">executive </strong>is correct with respect to some of the documents involved. But I can not say that disclosure of any of them will surely result in direct, immediate and irreparable damage to our nation or its people. That being so, there can under the First Amendment be but one judicial resolution of the issues <strong style="color: #e74c3c">before </strong>us.',"I join the judgments of the court.","Mr. Justice Marshall, concurring.",'The Government contends that the only issue in this case is whether in a suit by the United States, “the First Amendment bars a court from <strong style="color: #8e44ad">prohibiting </strong>a newspaper from publishing <strong style="color: #f39c12">material </strong>whose disclosure would pose a grave and immediate danger to <strong style="color: #27ae60">these </strong>curity of the United States.” Brief of the Government, at 6. With all due respect, I believe the ultimate issue in this case is even more basic than the one posed by the Solicitor General. The issue is whether this Court or the Congress has the power to make law.','In this case there is no problem <strong style="color: #3498db">concerning </strong>the Presitilmat\'s power to <strong style="color: #e67e22">classify </strong>information as “secret” or “top secret.” Congress has specifically <strong style="color: #e74c3c">recognized </strong>Presidential authority, which has been formally exercised in Executive Order 10501, to classify documents and information. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Section 798; 50 U.S.C. Section 783. Nor is there any issue here regarding the President\'s power as Chief Executive and <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Commander </strong>in Chief to protect national security by disciplining employes who disclose information and by taking precautions to prevent leaks.','The problem here is whether in this particular case the executive branch has authority to invoke the equity <strong style="color: #f39c12">jurisdiction </strong>of the courts to protect what it believes to be the national interest. See In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 584 (1895). The Government argues that in addition to the inherent power of any <strong style="color: #27ae60">government </strong>to protect itself, the President\'s power to conduct foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief give him authority to impose censor ship on the press to protect his ability to deal effectively with foreign nations and to conduct the military affairs of the country. Of course, it is beyond cavil that the President has broad powers by virtue of his primary responsibility for the conduct of our, foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948); Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 93 (1943); United States v. Curtiss Wright Export Co., 299 U. S. 304 (1936). And in some situations it may be that under whatever inherent powers the Government may have, as well as the implicit authority derived from the President\'s mandate to conduct foreign affairs and to act as Commander in Chief there is a basis for the invocation of the equity jurisdiction of this Court as an aid to prevent the publication of material damaging to “national <strong style="color: #3498db">security,” </strong>however, that term may be defined.','It would, however, be utterly <strong style="color: #e67e22">inconsistent </strong>with the concept of separation of power for this Court to use its power of contempt to prevent behavior that Congress has specifically declined to prohibit. There would be a similar <strong style="color: #e74c3c">damage </strong>to the basic concept of these <strong style="color: #8e44ad">coequal </strong>branches of government if when the executive has adequate authority granted by Congress to protect “national security,” it can choose instead to invoke the contempt power of a court to enjoin the threatened conduct. The Constitution provides that Congress shall make laws, the President execute laws, and courts interpret law. Youngs stown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952). It did not provide for government by injunction, in which the courts and the “executive can “make law” without regard to the action of Congress. It may be more convenient for the executive if it need only con vince a judge to prohibit conduct rather than to ask the Congress to pass a law, and it may be more convenient to enforce a contempt order than seek a criminal conviction in a jury trial. More over, it may be considered politically wise to get a court to share the <strong style="color: #f39c12">responsibility </strong>for arresting those who the executive has probably cause to believe are violating the law. But convenience and political considerations of the <strong style="color: #27ae60">moment </strong>do not justify a basic departure from the principles of our system of government.','In this case we are not faced with a situation where Congress has failed to provide the executive with broad power to protect the nation from disclosure of damaging state secrets. Congress has on several occasions given extensive consideration to the problem of <strong style="color: #3498db">protecting </strong>the military and strategic secrets of the United States. This consideration has resulted in the enactment of <strong style="color: #e67e22">statutes </strong>making it a crime to receive, disclose, communicate, withhold and publish certain documents, photographs, instruments, appliances and <strong style="color: #e74c3c">information </strong>The bulk of these statutes are found to Chapter 37 of U.S.C., Title 18, entitled “Espionage and Censorship.” In that chapter, Congress has provided penalties ranging from a $10,000 fine to death for violating the various statutes.',"Thus it would seem that in order for this Court to issue an injunction it would require a showing that such an injunction would enhance the already existing power of the Government to act. See Bennett v. Laman, 277 N. Y. 368, 14 N. E. 2d 439 (1938). It is a traditional axiom of equity that a court of equity will not do a useless thing just as it is a traditional axiom that equity will not enjoin the commission of a crime. See Z. Chaffe & E. Re, Equity 4935‐954 (5th ed. 1967); H. Joyce, injunctions sections 58‐60A, (1909). Here there has been no attempt to make such a showing. The Solicitor General does not even mention in his brief whether the Government considers there to be probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or whether there is a conspiracy to commit future crimes.",'If the Government had attempted to show that there was no effective remedy under traditional criminal law, it would have had to show that there is no arguably applicable statute. Of course, at this stage this Court could not and cannot determine whether there has been a violation of a particular statute nor decide the constitutionality of any statute. Whether a good‐faith <strong style="color: #8e44ad">prosecution </strong>could have been instituted under any statute could, however, be <strong style="color: #f39c12">determined.</strong>',"Relevant Statute Noted",'At least one of the many statutes In this area seems relevant to this case, Congress has provided in 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e) that whoever “having unauthorized possesion of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book ... or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, <strong style="color: #27ae60">transmits </strong>... the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employe of the United States entitled to receive it ... shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.” 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e). Congress has also made it a crime to conspire to commit any of the offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e).','It is true that Judge Gurfein found that Congress had not made it a crime to publish the items and material <strong style="color: #3498db">specified </strong>in Section 793 <strong style="color: #e67e22">(e):He </strong>found that the words “communicates, delivers, transmits ...” did not refer to <strong style="color: #e74c3c">publication </strong>of newspaper stories. And that view has some support in the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">legislative </strong>history and conforms with the past practice of using the statute only to prosecute those charged with ordinary espionage. But see 103 Cong. Rec. 10449 (remarks of Senator Humphrey). Judge Gurfein\'s view of the statute is not, however, the only plausible construction that could be given. See my brother White\'s concurring opinion.','Even if it is determined that the Government could not in good faith bring criminal prosecutions against The New York Times and The Washington Post, it is clear that Congress has <strong style="color: #f39c12">specifically </strong>rejected passing legislation that would have clearly given the President the power he seeks here and made the current activity of the newspapers <strong style="color: #27ae60">unlawful. </strong>When Congress specifically <strong style="color: #3498db">declines </strong>to make conduct unlawful it is not for this Court to redecide those issues —to overrule Congress.

In either case this Court does not have authority to grant the requested relief. It is not for this Court to fling itself into every breach perceived by some Government official, nor is it for this Court to take on itself the burden of enacting law, especially law that Congress has <strong style="color: #e74c3c">refused </strong>to pass.',"I believe that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia should be affirmed and the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit should be reversed insofar as it remands the case for further hearings.","Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas joins, concurring.",'I adhere to the view that the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Government\'s </strong>case against The Washington Post should have been dismissed and that the injunction against The New York Times should have been vacated without oral argument when the cases were first presented to this Court.

Furthermore, after oral arguments, I agree completely that we must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the. Second Circuit for the reasons stated by my brothers Douglas and Brennan. In my view it is unfortunate that some of my brethren are apparently willing to hold that the publication of news may some times be enjoined. Such a holding would make a shambles of the First <strong style="color: #3498db">Amendment.</strong>','Our Government was launched in 1789 with the adoption of the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Constitution. </strong>The Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment, followed in 1791. Now, for the first time in the 182 years since the founding of the Republic, the Federal courts are asked to hold that the First Amendment does not mean what it says, but rather means that the Government can halt the publication of current news of vital importance to the people of this country.','In seeking injunctions against these newspapers and in its presentation to the Court, the executive branch seems to have forgotten the essential purpose area History of the First Amendment. When the Constitution was adopted, many people strongly opposed it <strong style="color: #e74c3c">because </strong>the document contained no bill of rights to safeguard certain basic freedoms. They especially feared that the new powers granted to a central government might be interpreted to per mit the government to curtail freedom of religion, press, assembly and speech. In response to an overwhelming public clamor, James Madison offered a series of amendments to satisfy citizens that these great liberties would remain safe and beyond the power of government to abridge. Madison proposed what later became the First Amendment in three parts, two of which are set out below, and one of which proclaimed: “The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">freedom </strong>of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.” The amendments were offered to curtail and restrict the general powers granted to the executive, legislative and judicial branches two years before in the <strong style="color: #f39c12">original </strong>Constitution. The Bill of Rights changed the original Constitution into a new charter under which no, branch of government could abridge the pebple\'s freedoms of press, speech, religion and assembly.',"‘Perversion of History’",'Yet the Solicitor General argues and some members of the Court appear to agree that the general powers of the Government adopted in the original Constitution should be interpreted to limit and restrict the specifie and <strong style="color: #27ae60">emphatic </strong>guarantees of the Bill of Rights adopted later. I can imagine no greater perversion of history. Madison and the other framers of the First Amendment, able men that they were, wrote in <strong style="color: #3498db">language </strong>they earnestly believed could never be misunderstood: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of the press.” Both the history and <strong style="color: #e67e22">language </strong>of the First Amendment support the view that the press must be left free to publish news, whatever the source, without censorship, injunctions or prior restraints.','In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">protection </strong>it must have to fulfill its essential role in our demobracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">governors. </strong>The Government\'s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to cen sure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the <strong style="color: #f39c12">Government </strong>from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell. In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their courageous <strong style="color: #27ae60">reporting, </strong>The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly. In revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam war, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the founders hoped and trusted they would do.',"The Government's case here, is based on premises entirely different from those that guided the framers of the First Amendment. The Solicitor General has carefully and emphatically stated:",'“Now, Mr. Justice [Black], your <strong style="color: #3498db">construction </strong>of ... [the First Amendment] is well known, and I certainly respect it. You say that no law means no law, and that should be obvious. I can only say, Mr. Justice, that to me it is equally obvious that ‘no law,’ and I would seek to persuade the Court that that is true ... [t]here are other parts of the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Constitution </strong>that grant power and <strong style="color: #e74c3c">responsibilities </strong>to the executive and ... the First Amendment was not intended to make it impossible for the executive to function or to protect the security of the United States.”',"Government Stand Rebutted",'And the Government argues in its brief that in spite of the First <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Amendment, </strong>“the authority of the executive department to protect the nation against publication of information whose <strong style="color: #f39c12">disclosure </strong>would endanger the national <strong style="color: #27ae60">security </strong>stems from two interrelated sources: the constitutional power of the President over the conduct of foreign affairs and his authority as <strong style="color: #3498db">Commander </strong>in Chief.”','In other words, we are asked to hold that despite the First Amendment\'s <strong style="color: #e67e22">emphatic </strong>command, the executive branch, the Congress and the judiciary can make laws enjoining publication of current news and abridging freedom of the press in the name of “national security.” The Government does not even attempt to rely on act of Congress. Instead it makes the bold and dangerously far reaching contention that the courts should take it upon themselves to “make” a law abridging freedom of the press in the name of equity, Presidential power and national security, even when the representatives of the people in Congress have adhered to the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">command </strong>of the First Amendment and <strong style="color: #8e44ad">refused </strong>to make such a law. See concur ring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas, Post.','To find that the President has <strong style="color: #f39c12">“inherent </strong>power” to halt the publication of news by resort to the courts would wipe out the First Amendment and <strong style="color: #27ae60">destroy </strong>the fundamental liberty and <strong style="color: #3498db">security </strong>of the very people the <strong style="color: #e67e22">Government </strong>hopes to make “secure.” No one can read the history of the adoption of the First Amendment without being convinced beyond any doubt that it was injunctions like those sought here that Madison and his collaborators intended to outlaw in this nation for all time.','The word “security” is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment. The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at, the expense of informed <strong style="color: #e74c3c">representative </strong>government provides no real security for our Republic.',"The framers of the First Amendment, fully aware of both the need to defend a new nation and the abuses of the English and colonial Governments, sought to give this new society strength and security by providing that freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly should not be abridged. This thought was eloquently expressed in 1937 by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes—great man and great Chief Justice that he was— when the Court held a man could not be punished for attending a meeting run by Communists.",'“The greater the importance of safe guarding the community from incite ments to the overthrow: of our <strong style="color: #8e44ad">institutions </strong>by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve in violate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of consti ional government.”',"Mr. Justice White, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart joins, concurring.",'I concur in today\'s judgments, but only because of the concededly <strong style="color: #f39c12">extraordinary </strong>protection against prior, <strong style="color: #27ae60">restraints </strong>enjoyed by the press under our constitutional system. I do not say that in no circumstances would the First Amendment permit an injunction against publishing information about Government plans or operations. Nor, after examining the materials the <strong style="color: #3498db">Government </strong>characterizes as the most sensitive and destructive, can I deny that revelation of these documents will do substantial damage to public <strong style="color: #e67e22">interests. </strong>Indeed, I am confident that their disclosure will have that result. But I nevertheless agree that the United States has, not satisfied the very heavy burden, which it must meet to warrant an injuction against publication in these cases, at least in the absence of express and appropriately limited Congressional authorization for prior restraints in circumstances such as these.','The Government\'s position if simply stated: The responsibility of the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">executive </strong>for the conduct of the foreign affairs and for the security of the nation is so basic that the President is entitled to an injunction against <strong style="color: #8e44ad">publication </strong>of a newspaper story whenever he can convince a court that the <strong style="color: #f39c12">information </strong>to be revealed threatens “grave and irreparable” injury to the public interest; and the injunction should issue whether or not the material to be published is classified, whether or not publication would be lawful under relevant criminal statutes enacted by Congress and regardless of the <strong style="color: #27ae60">circumstances </strong>by which the newspaper came into possession of the information.','At least in the absence of legislation by Congress, based on its own <strong style="color: #3498db">investigations </strong>and findings, I am quite unable to agree that the inherent powers of the executive and the courts reach so far as to authorize remedies having such sweeping potential for inhibiting publications by the press. Much of the difficulty inheres in the “grave and irreparable danger” standard <strong style="color: #e67e22">suggested </strong>by the United States. If the. United States were to have judgment under such a standard in these cases, our decision would be of little guidance to other courts in other cases, for the material at issue here would not be available from the Court\'s opinion or from public records, nor would it be published by the press. Indeed, even today where we hold that the United States has not met its burden, the material remains sealed in court <strong style="color: #e74c3c">records </strong>and it is properly not discussed in today\'s opinions. Moreover, because the, material poses substantial dangers to national interests and because of the hazards of criminal sanctions, a responsible press may choose never to publish the more sensitive materials. To sustain the Government in these cases would start the courts down a long and hazardous road that I am not willing to travel, at least without <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Congressional </strong>guidance and direction.',"‘Not Easy to Deny Relief’",'It is not easy to reject the proposition urged by the United. States and to deny relief on its good‐faith claims in these cases that publication will work serious damage to the country. But that <strong style="color: #f39c12">discomfiture </strong>is considerably dispelled by the infrequency of prior restraint cases. Normally, publication will occur and the damage be done before the Government has either opportunity or grounds for suppression. So here, publication has already begun and a substantial part of the threatened damage has already occurred. The fact of a massive break down in security is known, access to the documents by many unauthorizes people is undeniable and the efficacy of equitable relief against these or other newspapers to avert anticipated damage is doubtful at best.','What is more, terminating the ban on publication of the relatively few <strong style="color: #27ae60">sensitive </strong>documents the Government now seeks to suppress does not mean that the law either requires or invites news papers or others to publish them or that they will be immune from criminal <strong style="color: #3498db">action </strong>if they do. Prior restraints require an unusually heavy justification under the First Amendment; but failure by the Government to justify prior <strong style="color: #e67e22">restraints </strong>does not measure its <strong style="color: #e74c3c">constitutional </strong>entitlement to a conviction for criminal publication. That the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Government </strong>mistakenly chose to proceed by injunction does not mean that it could not successfully proceed in another way.','When the Espionage Act was under consideration in 1917, Congress <strong style="color: #f39c12">eliminated </strong>from the bill a provision that would have given the President broad powers in time of war to proscribe, under threat of criminal penalty, the publication of various categories of <strong style="color: #27ae60">information </strong>related to the national <strong style="color: #3498db">defense. </strong>Congress at that time was <strong style="color: #e67e22">unwilling </strong>to clothe the President with such far‐reaching powers to monitor the press, and those opposed to this part of the legislation assumed that a <strong style="color: #e74c3c">necessary </strong>concomitant of such power was the power to “filter out the news to the people through some man.” 55 Cong. Rec. 2008 (1917) (remarks of Senator Ashurst). However, these same <strong style="color: #8e44ad">members </strong>of Congress appeared to have little doubt that newspapers would be subject to criminal prosecution if they insisted on publishing information of the type Congress had itself determined should not be revealed. Senator Ashurst, for example, was quite sure that the editor of such a newspaper (“should be punished if he did publish information as to the movements of the fleet, the troops, the aircraft, the location of powder <strong style="color: #f39c12">factories, </strong>the location of defense works and all that sort of thing.” 55 Cong. Rec. 2009 (1917).','The Criminal Code contains numerous provisions potentially relevant to these cases. Section 797 makes it a crime to publish certain photographs or drawings of military installations. Section 798, also in precise language, proscribes knowing and willful publications of any classified information concerning the cryptographic systems or <strong style="color: #27ae60">communication </strong>intelligence activities of the United States as well as any <strong style="color: #3498db">information </strong>obtained from communication <strong style="color: #e67e22">intelligence </strong>operations. If any of the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">material </strong>here at issue is of this nature, the newspapers are presumably now on full notice of the position of the United States and must face the consequences if they publish. I would have no <strong style="color: #8e44ad">difficulty </strong>in sustaining convictions under these sections on facts that would not Justify the intervention of equity and the imposition of a prior restraint.',"Under ‘a Wider Net’",'The same would be true under those sections of the Criminal Code casting a wider net to protect thee national <strong style="color: #f39c12">defense. </strong>Section 798 (e) makes it a <strong style="color: #27ae60">criminal </strong>act for any unauthorized possessor of a document “relating to national <strong style="color: #3498db">defense” </strong>either (1) willfully to <strong style="color: #e67e22">communicate </strong>or cause to be communicated that document to any person not entitled to receive it or (2) willfully to retain the document and fail to deliver it to an officer of the United States entitled to receive it. The subsection was added in 1950 because pre‐existing law provided no penalty for the unauthorized <strong style="color: #e74c3c">possessor </strong>unless demand for the documents was made. “The dangers surrounding the unauthorized possession of such items; are self‐evident, and it is deemed advisable to require their surrender in such a case, regardless of demand, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">especially </strong>since their, unauthorized pos session may be unknown to the <strong style="color: #f39c12">authorities </strong>who would otherwise make the <strong style="color: #27ae60">demand.” </strong>S. Rep. No. 2369, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1950). Of course, in the cases before us, the unpublished documents have been demanded by the United States and their import has been made known at least to counsel for the news papers involved. In Gorin v. United States, 312 U. S. 19, 28 (1941), the words “national defense” as used in a predecessor of Sec. 793, were held by a unanimous court to have “a well‐under stood connotation”—a “generic concept of broad connotations, referring to the military and naval establishments and the related activities of national <strong style="color: #3498db">preparedness”—</strong>and to be “sufficiently <strong style="color: #e67e22">definite </strong>to apprise the public of prohibited activities” and to be consonant with due process. 312 U. S., at 28. Also, as <strong style="color: #e74c3c">construed </strong>by the Court in Gorin, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">information </strong>“connected with the national <strong style="color: #f39c12">defense” </strong>is obviously not limited to that threatening “grave and irreparable” <strong style="color: #27ae60">injury </strong>to the United States.','It is thus clear that Congress has addressed itself to the problems of <strong style="color: #3498db">protecting </strong>the security of the country and the national defense from unauthorized disclosure of potentially damaging formation. Cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585‐586 (1952): see also id., at 593.628 <strong style="color: #e67e22">(Frankfurter, </strong>J., concurring). Lt has not, how ever, authorized the injunctive remedy against threatened publication. It has apparently been satisfied to rely on criminal sanctions and their deterrent effect on the responsible as well as the irresponsible press. I am not, of course, saying that either of these newspapers has yet committed a crime or that either would commit a crime if they published all the material now in their possession. That matter must await resolution in the context of a criminal proceeding one is instituted by the United States. In that event, the issue of guilt or <strong style="color: #e74c3c">innocence </strong>would be determined by <strong style="color: #8e44ad">procedures </strong>and standards quite different from those that have purported to govern these injunctive proceedings.',"Dissents",'Mr. Chief Justice Burger, <strong style="color: #f39c12">dissenting.</strong>','So clear are the constitutional <strong style="color: #27ae60">limitations </strong>on prior restraint against <strong style="color: #3498db">expression, </strong>that from the time of Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697 (1931), until recently in Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, (1971), we have had little occasion to be concerned with cases involving prior restraints against news reporting on matters of public interest. There is, therefore, little <strong style="color: #e67e22">variation </strong>among the members of the Court in terms of resistance to prior restraints against publication. Adherence to this basic constitutional principle, however, does not make this case a simple one. In this case, the imperative of a free and unfettered press comes into <strong style="color: #e74c3c">collision </strong>with another imperative, the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">effective </strong>functioning of a complex modern government, and specifically the <strong style="color: #f39c12">effective </strong>exercise of certain constitutional powers of the executive. Only those who view the First Amendment as an absolute in all circumstances—a View I respect, but reject—can find such a case as this to be simple or easy.',"This case is not simple for another and more immediate reason. We do not know the facts of the case. No District Judge knew all type facts. No Court of Appeals Judge knew all the facts. No member of this Court knows all the facts.","Why are we in this posture, in which only those judges to whom the First Amendment is absolute and permits of no restraint in any circumstances or for any reason, are really in a position to act?",'I suggest we, are in this pasture <strong style="color: #27ae60">because </strong>these cases have been conducted in unseemly haste. Mr. Justice Harlin covers the chronology of events <strong style="color: #3498db">demonstrating </strong>the hectic pressures under which these cases have been processed and I need not restate them; The prompt setting of these cases reflects our pni vessel abhorrence of prior restraint. But prompt judicial action does not mean unjudicial haste.','Here, moreover, the frenetic haste is due in large part to the manner in which The Times proceeded from the date it obtained the purloined <strong style="color: #e67e22">documents. </strong>It seems reasonably clear now that the haste precluded reasonable and deliberate judicial treatment of these cases and was not warranted. The <strong style="color: #e74c3c">precipitous </strong>action of this court aborting a trial not yet completed is not the kind of judicial conduct which ought to attend the disposition of a great issue.',"‘The Public Right to Know’",'The newspapers make a derivative claim under the First Amendment they, denominate this right as the public right to know; by implication. The Times asserts a sole trusteeship of that right by virtue of its journalist “scoop.” The right is asserted as an absolute. Of course, the First Amendment right itself is not an absolute, as Justice Holmes so long Ago pointed out in his aphorism concerning the right to shout of fire in a crowded theater. There are other <strong style="color: #8e44ad">exceptions, </strong>some of which Chief Justice Hughes mentioned by way, of example in Near v. Minnesota. There are no doubt other exceptions no one has had occasion to describe or discuss. <strong style="color: #f39c12">Conceivably </strong>such exceptions may be lurking in these cases and would have been flushed had they been properly <strong style="color: #27ae60">considered </strong>in the trial courts, free from <strong style="color: #3498db">unwarranted </strong>deadlines and frenetic <strong style="color: #e67e22">pressures.</strong>',"A great issue of this kind should be tried in a judicial atmosphere conducive to thoughtful, reflective deliberation, especially when haste, in terms of hours, is unwarranted in light of the long period The Times, by its own choice, deferred publication.",'It is not disputed that The Times has had unauthorized possession of the documents for three to four months, during which it has had its expert analysts studying them, presumably digesting them and preparing the material for publication. During all of this time, The Times, presumably in its capacity as trustee of the public\'s “right, to know,” has held up <strong style="color: #e74c3c">publication </strong>for purposes it considered proper and thus public knowledge was delayed. No doubt this was for a good reason; the analysis of 7,000 pages of complex material drawn from a vastly greater volume of material would inevitably take time and the writing of good news stories takes time.','But why should the United States Government, from whom this <strong style="color: #8e44ad">information </strong>was illegally acquired by someone, along with all the counsel, trial judges, and appellate judges be placed under needless pressure? After these months of deferral, the alleged right to know has somehow and suddenly become a right that must be vindicated instanter.','Would it have been unreasonable, since the newspaper could anticipate the Government\'s objections to release of secret material, to give the <strong style="color: #f39c12">Government </strong>an opportunity to review the <strong style="color: #27ae60">entire </strong>collection and determine whether agreement could be reached on publica tion? Stolen or not, if security was not in fact jeopardized, much of the material could no doubt have been declassified, since it spans a period ending in 1968.',"‘Duty of Honorable Press’",'With such an approach—one that great newspapers have in the past <strong style="color: #3498db">practiced </strong>and stated editorially to be the duty of honorable press—the <strong style="color: #e67e22">newspapers </strong>and Government might well have narrowed the area of disagreement as to what was and was not publishable, leaving the remainder to be resolved in orderly litigation if necessary. To me it is hardly believable that a newspaper long regarded as a great institution in American life would fail to perform one of the basic and simple duties of every citizen with respect to the discovery or possession of stolen property or secret Government documents. That duty, I had thought—perhaps naively—was to report forthwith, to responsible public officers. This duty rests on taxi drivers, justices and The New York Times. The course followed by The Times, whether so calculated or not, removed any <strong style="color: #e74c3c">possibility </strong>of orderly litigation of the issues. If the action of the judges up to now has been correct, that result is sheer happenstance.',"Our grant of the writ before final judgment in The Times cage aborted the trial in the District Court before it had made a complete record pursuant to the mandate of the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.",'The consequences of all this <strong style="color: #8e44ad">melancholy </strong>series of events is that we <strong style="color: #f39c12">literally </strong>do not know what we are acting on. As I see it we have been forced to deal with litigation concerning rights of great magnitude without an adequate record, and surely without time for adequate treatment either in the prior proceedings or in this court.

These immediate interests exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes what previously was clear seem doubtful, and before which even, well settled princinles of law will bend.”',"With all respect, I consider that the Court has been almost irresponsibly feverish in dealing with these cases.",'Both the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Ciruit rendered judgment on June 23. The New York Times\'s petition for certiorari, its motion for accelerated <strong style="color: #f39c12">consideration </strong>thereof, and its application for interim relief were filed in this Court on June 24 at about 11 A.M. The <strong style="color: #27ae60">application </strong>of the United States for interim relief in The Post case was also filed here on June 24, at about 7:15. P.M. This Court\'s order setting a hearing before us on. June 26 at 11 A.M., a course which I joined. only to avoid, the possibility of even more peremptory action by the Court, was issued less than 24 hours before. The record in The Post case was filed with the clerk shortly before 1 P.M. on June 25; the record in The Times case did net arrive until 7 or 8 o\'clock that same night. The briefs of the parties were received less than two hours before argument on June 26.','This frenzied train of events took place in the name of the presumption against prior restraints created by the First Amendment.

In order decide the merits of these cases <strong style="color: #3498db">properly, </strong>some or all of the following <strong style="color: #e67e22">questions </strong>should have been faced:','1. Whether the Attorney General is authorized to bring these suits in the name of the United States. Compare In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895), with Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 479 (1952). This <strong style="color: #e74c3c">question </strong>involves as well the construction and validity of a singularly opaque statute—the Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 793 (e).','2. Whether the First Amendment <strong style="color: #8e44ad">permits </strong>the Federal Courts to enjoin <strong style="color: #f39c12">publication </strong>of stories which would present a serious threat to national security, See Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931) (dictum).','3. Whether the threat to publish highly secret documents is of itself a sufficient implication of national <strong style="color: #27ae60">security </strong>to justify an injunction on the theory that regardless of the contents of the documents harm enough results simply from the demonstration of such a breach of secrecy.','4. Whether the unauthorized <strong style="color: #3498db">disclosure </strong>of any of these particular <strong style="color: #e67e22">documents </strong>would seriously impair the national security.',"5. What weight should be given to the opinion of high officers in the executive branch of the. Government with respect to questions 3 and 4.",'6. Whether the newspapers are <strong style="color: #e74c3c">entitled </strong>to retain and use the documents notwithstanding the seemingly <strong style="color: #8e44ad">uncontested </strong>facts that the documents, or the original of which they are duplicates, were purloined from the Government\'s possession and that the newspapers received them with the knowledge that they had been feloniously acquired. Cf. Liberty Lobby, Inc., v. Pearson, 390 F. 2d 489 (CADC 1968).','7. Whether the threatened harm to, the national security or the <strong style="color: #f39c12">Government\'s </strong>possessory interest in the <strong style="color: #27ae60">documents </strong>justifies the issuance of an injunction against publication in light of—','A. The strong First Amendment policy against prior restraints on <strong style="color: #3498db">publication:</strong>','B. The doctrine against enjoining <strong style="color: #e67e22">conduct </strong>in violation of criminal statutes; and',"C. The extent to which the materials at issue have apparently already been otherwise disseminated.","‘Difficult Questions of Fact, Law’",'These are difficult questions of fact, of law and of judgment; the potential Consequences of erroneous decision are enormous. The time which has been available to us, to the lower courts and to the parties has been wholly <strong style="color: #e74c3c">inadequate </strong>for giving these cases the kind of consideration they deserve. It is a reflection on the stability of the judicial prdcess that these great issues—as <strong style="color: #8e44ad">important </strong>as any that have arisen during my time on the Court—should have been decided under the pressures engendered by the torrent of publicity that has attended these litigations from their inception.',"Forced as I am to reach the merits of these cases, I dissent from the opinion and judgments of the Court. Within the severe limitations imposed by the time constraints under which I have been required to operate, I can only state my reasons in telescoped form, even though in different circumstances I would have felt constrained to deal with the cases in the fuller sweep indicated above.",'It is a sufficient basis for affirming the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in The Times litigation to <strong style="color: #f39c12">observe </strong>that its order must rest on the conclusion that because of the time elements the Government had not been given an adequate opportunity to <strong style="color: #27ae60">present </strong>its case to the District Court. At the least this conclusion was not an abuse of discretion.','In The Post litigation the Government had more time to prepare; this was apparently the basis for the refusal of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on reheating to conform its judgment to that of the Second Circuit But I think there is another and more fundamental reason why this judgment cannot stand—a reason which also furnishes an <strong style="color: #3498db">additional </strong>ground for not reinstating the judgment of the district court in The Times litigation, set aside by the Court of Appeals. It is plain to me that the scope of the judicial function in passing upon the activities of the executive branch of the Government in the field of foreign affairs is very narrowly <strong style="color: #e67e22">restricted. </strong>This view is, I think, dictated by the concept of separation of powers upon which our constitutional system rests.',"In a speech on the floor of the House of. Representatives, Chief Justice John Marshall, then a member of that body, stated:","“The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and a its sole representative with foreign nations.” Annals, 6th Cong., Col. 613 (1800).","From that time, shortly after the founding of the nation, to this, there has been no substantial challenge to this description of the scope of executive power. See United States v. Curtiss Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319‐321 (1936), collecting authorities.",'From this constitutional primacy in the field of foreign affairs, it seems to me that certain conclusions necessarily follow. Some of these were stated <strong style="color: #e74c3c">concisely </strong>by President Washington, <strong style="color: #8e44ad">declining </strong>the request of the House of <strong style="color: #f39c12">Representatives </strong>for the papers leading up to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty:',"“The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy; and even when brought to a conclusion a full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions which may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely impolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations, or produce immediate in conveniences, perhaps danger and mis chief, in relation to other powers.” J. Richardson, “Messages and Papers of the Presidents” 194‐195 (1899).","Need for Judicial Review Seen",'The power to evaluate the “pernicious influence” of premature disclosure is not, however, lodged in the executive alone. I agree that, in performance of its duty to protect the values of the First Amendmen against political <strong style="color: #27ae60">pressures, </strong>the judiciary must review the initial executive determination to the point of satisfying itself that the subject matter of the dispute does lie within the proper compass of the President\'s <strong style="color: #3498db">foreign </strong>relations power. Constitutional <strong style="color: #e67e22">considerations </strong>forbid “a complete abandon ment of judicial control.” Cf. United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 8 (1953). Moreover, the judiciary may properly insist that the determination that disclosure of the subject matter would irreparably impair the national security be made by the head of the executive department concerned —here the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense—after actual personal <strong style="color: #e74c3c">consideration </strong>by that office. This safe guard is required in the analogous area of executive claims of privilege for <strong style="color: #8e44ad">secrets </strong>of state. See United States v. Reynolds, supra, at 8 <strong style="color: #f39c12">andN. </strong>20; Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., (1942) A. C. 624, 638 (House of Lords).','But in my judgment the judiciary may not properly go beyond these two <strong style="color: #27ae60">inquiries </strong>and redetermine for itself the probable impact of disclosure on the national security.','“The very nature of executive deci cisins as to foreign policy is political, not judicial. Such decisions are wholly confided by our Constitution to the <strong style="color: #3498db">political </strong>departments of the Government, executive and legislative. They are <strong style="color: #e67e22">delicate, </strong>complex, and involve large <strong style="color: #e74c3c">element\'s </strong>of prophecy. They are and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil. They are <strong style="color: #8e44ad">decisions </strong>of a kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor <strong style="color: #f39c12">responsibility </strong>and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.” Chicago & Southern Air Lines v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948) (Jackson, J.).','Even if there is some room for the judiciary to override the executive <strong style="color: #27ae60">determination, </strong>it is plain that the scope of review must he exceedingly narrow. I can see no indication in the opinions of either the District Court or the Court of Appeals in The Post litigation that the conclusions of the executive were given even the deference owing to an administrative agency, much less that owing to a coequal constitutional <strong style="color: #3498db">prerogative.</strong>','Accordingly, I would vacate the <strong style="color: #e67e22">judgment </strong>of the Court of Appeals for the, District of Columbia Circuit on this ground and remand the case for further proceedings in the District Court. Before the commencement of such further <strong style="color: #e74c3c">proceedings, </strong>due opportunity should be afforded the Government for procuring from the Secretary of State or the <strong style="color: #8e44ad">Secretary </strong>of Defense or both an expression of their views on the issue of national security. The ensuing review by the District Court should be in accordance with the views expressed in this <strong style="color: #f39c12">opinion. </strong>And for the reasons stated above I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.','Pending further hearings in each case conducted under the appropriate ground rules, I would continue the restraints on publication. I cannot believe that the doctrine prohibiting prior restraints reaches to the point of preventing courts from maintaining the status quo long enough to act responsibly in <strong style="color: #27ae60">matters </strong>of such national importance as those involved here.',"Mr. Justice Blackmun.","I join Mr. Justice Harlan in his dis sent. I also am in substantial accord with much that Mr. Justice White says, by way of admonition, in the latter part of his opinion.",'At this point the focus is on only the comparatively few documents <strong style="color: #3498db">specified </strong>by the Government as critical. So far as the other material — vast in amount—is concerned, let it be <strong style="color: #e67e22">published </strong>and published forthwith if the newspapers, once the strain is gone and the sensationalism is eased, still feel the urge so to do.','But we are concerned here with the few documents specified from the 47 volumes. Almost 70 years ago Mr. <strong style="color: #e74c3c">Justice </strong>Holmes, dissenting in a celebrated case, observed:','“Great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases are called great, not by reason of their real <strong style="color: #8e44ad">importance </strong>in shaping the law of the <strong style="color: #f39c12">future, </strong>but because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment. These immediate interests <strong style="color: #27ae60">exercise </strong>a kind of hydraulic pressure. ...” Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 400‐401 (1964).','The present cases, if not great, are at least unusual in their posture and <strong style="color: #3498db">implications, </strong>and the Holmes observation certainly, has pertinent application.','The New York Times clandestinely devoted a period of three months <strong style="color: #e67e22">examining </strong>the 47 volumes that came into its unauthorized possession. Once it had begun publication of material from those volumes, the New York case now before us emerged. It immediately as sullied, and ever since has maintained, a frenetic pace and character. Seemingly, once publication started, the material could not be made public fast enough. Seemingly, from then on, every deferral or delay, by restraint or otherwise, was abhorrent and was to be deemed viola tive of the First Amendment and of the public\'s “right immediately to know.” Yet that newspaper stood before us at oral argument and professed:, criticism of the Government for not lodging its protest earlier than by a Monday tele gram following the initial Sunday pub libation.',"The District of Columbia case is much the same.","‘Pressed Into Hurried Decision’",'Two Federal District Courts, two United States Courts of Appeals, and this Court—within a period of less than three weeks from inception until today —have been pressed into hurried <strong style="color: #e74c3c">decision </strong>of profound constitutional issues on inadequately developed and largely assumed facts without the careful <strong style="color: #8e44ad">deliberation </strong>that, hopefully, should <strong style="color: #f39c12">characterize </strong>the American judicial process. There has been much writing about the law and little knowledge and less <strong style="color: #27ae60">digestion </strong>of the facts. In the New York case the judges, both trial and appellate, had not yet examined the basic material when the case was brought here. In the District of Columbia case, little more was done, and what was accomplished in this respect was only on required <strong style="color: #3498db">remand, </strong>with The Washington Post, on the excuse that it was trying to protect its source of information, initially refusing to reveal what material it actually <strong style="color: #e67e22">possessed, </strong>and with the District Court forced to make assumptions as to that possession.','With such respect as may be due to the contrary view, this, in my opinion, is not the way to try a law suit of this magnitude and asserted <strong style="color: #e74c3c">importance. </strong>It is not the way for Federal Courts to adjudicate, and to be <strong style="color: #8e44ad">required </strong>to adjudicate, issues that <strong style="color: #f39c12">allegedly </strong>concern the nation\'s vital <strong style="color: #27ae60">welfare. </strong>The country would be none the worse off were the cases tried quickly, to be sure, but in the customary and properly deliberative manner. The most recent of the material, it is said, date, no later than 1968, already about three years ago, and The Times itself took three months to formulate its plan of procedure and, thus, deprived its public for that period.',"The First Amendment, after all, is only one part of an entire Constitution. Article II of the great document vests in the executive branch primary power over the conduct of foreign affairs and places in that branch the responsibility for the nation's safety.","Each provision of the Constitution is important, and I cannot subscribe to a doctrine of unlimited absolutism for the First Amendment at the cost of downgrading other provisions.",'First Amendment absolutism has never commanded a majority of this court. See, for example, Near v. <strong style="color: #3498db">Minnesota, </strong>283 U.S. 697, 708 (1931), and Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919). What IT needed here is weighing, upon properly developed standards, of the broad right of the press to print and of the very narrow right of the Government to prevent. Such standards are not yet developed. The parties here are in disagreement as to what those standards should be. But even the newspapers concede that there are situations where restraint in order and is constitutional. Mr. <strong style="color: #e67e22">Justice </strong>Holmes gave us a suggestion when he said in Schenck:',"“It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.” 249 U.S., at 52.","‘Better Quality,’ of Presentation",'I therefore would remand these cases to be developed expeditiously, of course, but on a schedule permitting the <strong style="color: #e74c3c">orderly </strong>presentation of evidence from both sides, with the use of discovery, if necessary, as authorized by the rules, and with the preparation of briefs, oral argument and court opinions of a <strong style="color: #8e44ad">quality </strong>better than has been seen to this point. In making this last statement, I criticize no lawyer or judge. I know from past personal experience the agony of time pressure in the preparation of litigation. But these cases and the <strong style="color: #f39c12">issues </strong>involved and the courts, including this one, deserve better than has been produced thus far.',"It may well be that if these cases were allowed to develop as they should be developed, and to be tried as lawyers should try them and as courts should hear them, free of pressure and panic and sensationalism, other light would be shed on the situation and contrary considerations, for me, might prevail. But that is not the present posture of the litigation.","The Court, however, decides the cases today the other way. I therefore add one final comment.",'I strongly urge, and sincerely hope, that these two newspapers will be fully aware of their ultimate <strong style="color: #27ae60">responsibilities </strong>to the United States of <strong style="color: #3498db">America. </strong>Judge Wilkey, dissenting in the <strong style="color: #e67e22">District </strong>of Columbia case, after a review of only the affidavits before this Court, (the basic papers had not then been made available by either party), <strong style="color: #e74c3c">concluded </strong>that there were a number of examples of documents that, if in the possession of The Post, and if published, “could clearly result in great harm to the nation,” and he defined “harm” to mean “the death of soldiers, and <strong style="color: #8e44ad">destruction </strong>of alliances, the greatly <strong style="color: #f39c12">increased </strong>difficulty of negotiation with our enemies, the inability of our <strong style="color: #27ae60">diplomats </strong>to negotiate ....” I, for one, have now been able to give at least some cursory study not only to the affidavits, but to the material itself. I regret to say that from this examination I fear that Judge Wilkey\'s statements have possible foundation. I therefore share his concern. I hope that damage already has not been done. If, however, damage has been done, and if, with the Court\'s action today, these newspapers proceed to publish the critical documents and there results therefrom “the death of soldiers, the destruction of alliances, the greatly <strong style="color: #3498db">increased </strong>difficulty of negotiation with our enemies, the inability of our <strong style="color: #e67e22">diplomats </strong>to negotiate,” to which list I might add the factors of prolongation of the war and of further delay in the freeing of United States prisoners, then the nation\'s people will know where the responsibility for these sad <strong style="color: #e74c3c">consequences </strong>rests.']},{title:"Noncommercial Radio Network to Open on May 3",meta:{wordCount:552,published:"April 3, 1971",link:"https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/03/archives/noncommercial-radio-network-to-open-on-may-3.html"},fixedWords:20,original:["A live, noncommercial radio network will begin operation May 3 with the hook‐up of 90 stations, including New York City's two outlets, WNYC and WNYC‐FM.",'National Public Radio, <strong style="color: #3498db">fi nanced </strong>by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, will start With a review of news and <strong style="color: #e67e22">per sonalities </strong>from 5 to 6:30 P.M., Mondays through Fridays.

The television pictures of the first men on the moon joined mankind in common pride over the realization of a <strong style="color: #3498db">millennial </strong>dream. The first moon rocks brought back by Apollo 11 were treated—and properly so—as priceless treasures of almost infinite value to science.','Today, however, the atmosphere is far different. <strong style="color: #e67e22">Present </strong>plans call for only three, more Apollo flights after Apollo 14. A technology which cost the nation more than $20 billion to acquire is, in effect, being largely discarded as NASA pins its hope for survival on the Skylab, a manned orbiting space station whose focus will be directed toward earth far more than toward the planets and stars.','If the atmophere in which Apollo 14 waits to begin its journey is radically changed from that of any of its predecessors, there has been no change in the courage required of astronauts nor in the skill and devotion needed by the launch crew and the operational personnel on earth. Manned flights to the moon are supreme <strong style="color: #e74c3c">challenges </strong>to human bravery and ingenuity.
